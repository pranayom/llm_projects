      " The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it interacts with different gases and particles in the air. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and gets scattered more easily than other colors, especially by the nitrogen and oxygen molecules in the Earth's atmosphere. As a result, when we look up at the sky, we primarily see the blue light that got scattered, making the sky appear blue during a clear day.\n"

      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen.

      "As a result of this scattering, the blue light is dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance. The red light, on the other hand, travels straight through the atmosphere without being scattered, which is why it appears darker and less intense than the blue light.\n",
