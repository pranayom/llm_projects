      "The sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, which is the scattering of light by small particles or molecules in the atmosphere. The shorter, blue wavelengths are scattered more than the longer, red wavelengths, resulting in the blue color we see.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a more detailed explanation:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\n",
      "2. The shorter wavelengths of light, like blue and violet, are scattered more by these small molecules because they interact with them more frequently. This is known as Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described the phenomenon in the late 19th century.\n",
      "3. The longer wavelengths of light, like red and orange, are not scattered as much because they don't interact with the small molecules as often. Instead, they continue to travel in a more direct path to our eyes, reaching us with less scattering.\n",
      "4. As we look at the sky, we see the combined effect of all the scattered light, which is predominantly blue because it's been scattered more by the tiny molecules. This is why the sky appears blue during the daytime.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other factors can affect the color of the sky, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "* Atmospheric conditions: Dust, pollution, and water vapor in the air can scatter light differently, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.\n",
      "* Time of day: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays have to travel longer distances through the atmosphere, which scatters shorter wavelengths even more. This is why we often see more reddish hues during these times.\n",
      "* Altitude and atmospheric pressure: At higher altitudes or in areas with lower atmospheric pressure, the sky may appear more blue due to the reduced scattering of light.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, there you have it! The blue color of the sky is a result of the fascinating interplay between sunlight, tiny molecules in the atmosphere, and our perception.\n"

We\\'re gaining on them!  \\n  \\nI\\'m wasted on cross-country.  \\nWe Dwarves are natural sprinters.  \\n  \\nVery dangerous over short distances.  \\n  \\nRohan.  \\n  \\nHome of the Horse-lords.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s something strange at work here.  \\n  \\nSome evil gives speed  \\nto these creatures.  \\n  \\nSets its will against us.  \\n  \\nLegolas! What do your Elf-eyes see?  \\n  \\nThe Uruks turn northeast.  \\n  \\nThey are taking the Hobbits to Isengard.  \\n  \\nSaruman.  \\n  \\nThe world is changing.  \\n  \\nWho now has the strength to stand  \\nagainst the armies of Isengard...  \\n  \\n...and Mordor?  \\n  \\nTo stand against the might of Sauron  \\nand Saruman...  \\n  \\n...and the union of the two towers?  \\n  \\nTogether, my Lord Sauron...  \\n  \\n...we shall rule this Middle-earth.  \\n  \\nThe Old World will burn  \\nin the fires of industry.  \\n  \\nThe forests will fall.  \\n  \\nA new order will rise.  \\n  \\nWe will drive the machine of war  \\nwith the sword and the spear...  \\n  \\n...and the iron fists of the Orc.  \\n  \\nI want them armed and ready to march  \\nwithin two weeks!  \\n  \\nBut, my lord, there are too many!  \\n  \\nThey cannot all be armed in time,  \\nwe don\\'t have the means.  \\n  \\nBuild a dam, block the stream,  \\nwork the furnaces night and day.  \\n  \\nWe don\\'t have enough fuel  \\nto feed the fires.  \\n  \\nThe Forest of Fangorn  \\nlies on our doorstep.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Burn it.  \\n\\\\- Yes.  \\n  \\nWe will fight for you.  \\n  \\nSwear it.  \\n  \\nWe will die for Saruman.  \\n  \\nThe Horse-Men took your lands.  \\n  \\nThey drove your people into the hills  \\nto scratch a living off rocks.  \\n  \\nMurderers!  \\n  \\nTake back the lands they stole from you.  \\n  \\nBurn every village!  \\n  \\nWe have only to remove those  \\nwho oppose us.  \\n  \\nIt will begin in Rohan.  \\n  \\nToo long have these peasants  \\nstood against you.  \\n  \\nBut no more.  \\n  \\nEothain! Eothain!  \\n  \\nYou take your sister.  \\nYou\\'ll go faster with just two.  \\n  \\nPapa says Eothain must not ride Garulf.  \\n  \\nHe is too big for him.  \\n  \\nListen to me. You must ride to Edoras  \\nand raise the alarm.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Do you understand me?  \\n\\\\- Yes, Mama.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t want to leave.  \\nI don\\'t want to go, Mama.  \\n  \\nFreda, I will find you there.  \\n  \\nQuickly!  \\n  \\nGo, child.  \\n  \\nRohan, my lord...  \\n  \\n...is ready to fall.  \\n  \\nTheodred.  \\n  \\nFind the king\\'s son!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Mordor will pay for this.  \\n\\\\- These Orcs are not from Mordor.  \\n  \\nMy Lord Eomer, over here!  \\n  \\nHe\\'s alive.  \\n  \\nTheodred.  \\n  \\nYour son is badly wounded, my lord.  \\n  \\nHe was ambushed by Orcs.  \\n  \\nIf we don\\'t defend our country,  \\nSaruman will take it by force.  \\n  \\nThat is a lie.  \\n  \\nSaruman the White has ever been  \\nour friend and ally.  \\n  \\nGrima.  \\n  \\nGrima.  \\n  \\nGrima.  \\n  \\nOrcs are roaming freely  \\nacross our lands.  \\n  \\nUnchecked. Unchallenged.  \\nKilling at will.  \\n  \\nOrcs bearing the White Hand of Saruman.  \\n  \\nWhy do you lay these troubles  \\non an already troubled mind?  \\n  \\nCan you not see?  \\n  \\nYour uncle is wearied  \\nby your malcontent...  \\n  \\n...your warmongering.  \\n  \\nWarmongering?  \\n  \\nHow long is it since  \\nSaruman bought you?  \\n  \\nWhat was the promised price, Grima?  \\n  \\nWhen all the Men are dead,  \\nyou will take your share of the treasure?  \\n  \\nToo long have you watched my sister.  \\n  \\nToo long have you haunted her steps.  \\n  \\nYou see much, Eomer, son of Eomund.  \\n  \\nToo much.  \\n  \\nYou are banished forthwith  \\nfrom the kingdom of Rohan...  \\n  \\n...and all its domains  \\nunder pain of death.  \\n  \\nYou have no authority here.  \\n  \\nYour orders mean nothing.  \\n  \\nThis order does not come from me.  \\n  \\nIt comes from the king.  \\n  \\nHe signed it this morning.  \\n  \\nKeep breathing. That\\'s the key.  \\n  \\nBreathe.  \\n  \\nThey\\'ve run as if the very whips  \\nof their masters were behind them.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re not going no further...  \\n  \\n...until we\\'ve had a breather.  \\n  \\nGet a fire going!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nI think we might have made a mistake  \\nleaving the Shire, Pippin.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s making that noise?  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the trees.  \\n  \\nWhat?  \\n  \\nYou remember the Old Forest,  \\non the borders of Buckland?  \\n  \\nFolk used to say there was something in  \\nthe water that made the trees grow tall...  \\n  \\n...and come alive.  \\n  \\nAlive?  \\n  \\nTrees that could whisper...  \\n  \\n...talk to each other...  \\n  \\n...even move.  \\n  \\nI\\'m starving.  \\n  \\nWe ain\\'t had nothing but maggoty bread  \\nfor three stinking days.  \\n  \\nYeah!  \\n  \\nWhy can\\'t we have some meat?!  \\n  \\nWhat about them?  \\n  \\nThey\\'re fresh.  \\n  \\nThey are not for eating.  \\n  \\nWhat about their legs?  \\n  \\nThey don\\'t need those.  \\n  \\n\\\\- They look tasty.  \\n\\\\- Get back, scum!  \\n  \\nThe prisoners go to Saruman.  \\nAlive and unspoiled.  \\n  \\nAlive?  \\n  \\nWhy alive?  \\nDo they give good sport?  \\n  \\nThey have something.  \\nAn Elvish weapon.  \\n  \\nThe master wants it for the war.  \\n  \\nThey think we have the Ring.  \\n  \\nAs soon as they find out we don\\'t,  \\nwe\\'re dead.  \\n  \\nJust a mouthful...  \\n  \\n...a bit of the flank.  \\n  \\nLooks like meat\\'s back on the menu,  \\nboys.  \\n  \\nPippin.  \\n  \\nLet\\'s go.  \\n  \\nGo on.  \\n  \\nCall for help.  \\n  \\nSqueal.  \\n  \\nNo one\\'s going to save you now.  \\n  \\nPippin!  \\n  \\nA red sun rises.  \\n  \\nBlood has been spilled this night.  \\n  \\nRiders of Rohan...  \\n  \\n...what news from the Mark?  \\n  \\nWhat business does an Elf, a Man  \\nand a Dwarf have in the Riddermark?  \\n  \\nSpeak quickly!  \\n  \\nGive me your name, horse-master,  \\nand I shall give you mine.  \\n  \\nI would cut off your head, Dwarf...  \\n  \\n...if it stood but a little higher  \\nfrom the ground.  \\n  \\nYou would die before your stroke fell.  \\n  \\nI am Aragorn, son of Arathorn.  \\n  \\nThis is Gimli, son of Gloin,  \\nand Legolas of the Woodland Realm.  \\n  \\nWe are friends of Rohan  \\nand of Theoden, your king.  \\n  \\nTheoden no longer recognizes  \\nfriend from foe.  \\n  \\nNot even his own kin.  \\n  \\nSaruman has poisoned the mind  \\nof the king...  \\n  \\n...and claimed lordship over these lands.  \\n  \\nMy company are those loyal to Rohan.  \\n  \\nAnd for that, we are banished.  \\n  \\nThe White Wizard is cunning.  \\n  \\nHe walks here and there, they say...  \\n  \\n...as an old man hooded and cloaked.  \\n  \\nAnd everywhere, his spies  \\nslip past our nets.  \\n  \\nWe are no spies.  \\n  \\nWe track a party of Uruk-hai  \\nwestward across the plain.  \\n  \\nThey have taken two of our friends  \\ncaptive.  \\n  \\nThe Uruks are destroyed.  \\nWe slaughtered them during the night.  \\n  \\nBut there were two Hobbits.  \\nDid you see two Hobbits with them?  \\n  \\nThey would be small.  \\nOnly children to your eyes.  \\n  \\nWe left none alive.  \\n  \\nWe piled the carcasses and burned them.  \\n  \\nDead?  \\n  \\nI am sorry.  \\n  \\nHasufel! Arod!  \\n  \\nMay these horses bear you to better  \\nfortune than their former masters.  \\n  \\nFarewell.  \\n  \\nLook for your friends.  \\n  \\nBut do not trust to hope.  \\n  \\nIt has forsaken these lands.  \\n  \\nWe ride north!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s one of their wee belts.  \\n  \\nWe failed them.  \\n  \\nA Hobbit lay here.  \\n  \\nAnd the other.  \\n  \\nThey crawled.  \\n  \\nTheir hands were bound.  \\n  \\nTheir bonds were cut.  \\n  \\nThey ran over here.  \\n  \\nThey were followed.  \\n  \\nThe belt!  \\n  \\nRun!  \\n  \\nTracks lead away from the battle...  \\n  \\n...into Fangorn Forest.  \\n  \\nFangorn?  \\n  \\nWhat madness drove them in there?  \\n  \\nDid we lose him? I think we lost him.  \\n  \\nI\\'m going to rip out  \\nyour filthy little innards!  \\n  \\nCome here!  \\n  \\nTrees. Climb a tree.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s gone.  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nLet\\'s put a maggot hole in your belly!  \\n  \\nRun, Merry!  \\n  \\nLittle Orcs.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s talking, Merry.  \\nThe tree is talking.  \\n  \\nTree?  \\n  \\nI am no tree!  \\n  \\nI am an Ent.  \\n  \\nA tree-herder.  \\n  \\nA shepherd of the forest.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t talk to it, Merry.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t encourage it!  \\n  \\nTreebeard, some call me.  \\n  \\nAnd whose side are you on?  \\n  \\nSide?  \\n  \\nI am on nobody\\'s side...  \\n  \\n...because nobody\\'s on my side,  \\nlittle Orc.  \\n  \\nNobody cares for the woods anymore.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re not Orcs! We\\'re Hobbits!  \\n  \\nHobbits?  \\n  \\nNever heard of a Hobbit before.  \\n  \\nSounds like Orc mischief to me!  \\n  \\nThey come with fire.  \\n  \\nThey come with axes.  \\n  \\nGnawing, biting, breaking,  \\nhacking, burning!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Destroyers and usurpers! Curse them!  \\n\\\\- No!  \\n  \\nYou don\\'t understand. We\\'re Hobbits!  \\n  \\nHalflings!  \\n  \\nShire-folk!  \\n  \\nMaybe you are...  \\n  \\n...and maybe you aren\\'t.  \\n  \\nThe White Wizard will know.  \\n  \\nThe White Wizard?  \\n  \\nSaruman.  \\n  \\nSee? See?  \\n  \\nWe\\'ve led you out.  \\n  \\nHurry, Hobbitses. Hurry!  \\n  \\nVery lucky we find you.  \\n  \\nNice Hobbit.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s a bog. He\\'s led us into a swamp.  \\n  \\nA swamp, yes, yes.  \\n  \\nCome, master. We will take you  \\non safe paths through the mist.  \\n  \\nCome, Hobbits! Come! We go quickly.  \\n  \\nI found it. I did.  \\n  \\nThe way through the marshes.  \\n  \\nOrcs don\\'t use it.  \\nOrcs don\\'t know it.  \\n  \\nThey go around for miles and miles.  \\n  \\nCome quickly.  \\n  \\nSoft and quick as shadows we must be.  \\n  \\nI hate this place. It\\'s too quiet.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s been no sight nor sound  \\nof a bird for two days.  \\n  \\nNo, no birdses to eat.  \\n  \\nNo crunchable birdses.  \\n  \\nWe are famished! Yes!  \\n  \\nFamished we are, precious!  \\n  \\nHere.  \\n  \\nWhat does it eats?  \\n  \\nIs it tasty?  \\n  \\nIt tries to chokes us!  \\n  \\nWe can\\'t eats Hobbit food!  \\n  \\nWe must starve!  \\n  \\nWell, starve, then. And good riddance!  \\n  \\nOh, cruel Hobbit.  \\n  \\nIt does not care if we be hungry.  \\n  \\nDoes not care if we should die.  \\n  \\nNot like master.  \\n  \\nMaster cares.  \\n  \\nMaster knows.  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nPrecious.  \\n  \\nOnce it takes hold of us...  \\n  \\n...it never lets go.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t touch me!  \\n  \\nThere are dead things!  \\n  \\nDead faces in the water.  \\n  \\nAll dead. All rotten.  \\n  \\nElves and Men and Orcses.  \\n  \\nA great battle long ago.  \\n  \\nDead Marshes.  \\n  \\nYes. Yes, that is their name.  \\n  \\nThis way.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t follow the lights.  \\n  \\nCareful now! Or Hobbits go down  \\nto join the dead ones...  \\n  \\n...and light little candles  \\nof their own.  \\n  \\nFrodo!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Gollum?  \\n\\\\- Don\\'t follow the lights.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Gollum!  \\n\\\\- Mr. Frodo!  \\n  \\nAre you all right?  \\n  \\nSo bright.  \\n  \\nSo beautiful.  \\n  \\nOur precious.  \\n  \\nWhat did you say?  \\n  \\nMaster should be resting.  \\n  \\nMaster needs to keep up his strength.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Who are you?  \\n\\\\- Mustn\\'t ask us. Not its business.  \\n  \\nGollum. Gollum.  \\n  \\nGandalf told me you were  \\none of the river-folk.  \\n  \\nCold be heart and hand and bone  \\nCold be travelers far from home  \\n  \\nHe said your life was a sad story.  \\n  \\nThey do not see what lies ahead  \\nWhen sun has failed and moon is dead  \\n  \\nYou were not so very different  \\nfrom a Hobbit once.  \\n  \\nWere you?  \\n  \\nSmeagol.  \\n  \\nWhat did you call me?  \\n  \\nThat was your name once, wasn\\'t it?  \\n  \\nA long time ago.  \\n  \\nMy name.  \\n  \\nMy name.  \\n  \\nSmeagol.  \\n  \\nBlack Riders!  \\n  \\nHide! Hide!  \\n  \\nCome on, Frodo. Come on!  \\n  \\nQuick! They will see us!  \\nThey will see us!  \\n  \\n\\\\- I thought they were dead.  \\n\\\\- Dead?  \\n  \\nNo, you cannot kill them. No.  \\n  \\nWraiths!  \\n  \\nWraiths on wings!  \\n  \\nThey are calling for it.  \\n  \\nThey are calling for the precious.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo! It\\'s all right.  \\n  \\nI\\'m here.  \\n  \\nHurry, Hobbits.  \\n  \\nThe Black Gate is very close.  \\n  \\nOrc blood.  \\n  \\nThese are strange tracks.  \\n  \\nThe air is so close in here.  \\n  \\nThis forest is old.  \\n  \\nVery old.  \\n  \\nFull of memory...  \\n  \\n...and anger.  \\n  \\nThe trees are speaking to each other.  \\n  \\nGimli!  \\n  \\nLower your ax.  \\n  \\nThey have feelings, my friend.  \\n  \\nThe Elves began it.  \\n  \\nWaking up the trees,  \\nteaching them to speak.  \\n  \\nTalking trees.  \\n  \\nWhat do trees have to talk about?  \\n  \\nExcept the consistency  \\nof squirrel droppings.  \\n  \\nThe White Wizard approaches.  \\n  \\nDo not let him speak.  \\nHe will put a spell on us.  \\n  \\nWe must be quick.  \\n  \\nYou are tracking the footsteps  \\nof two young Hobbits.  \\n  \\nWhere are they?  \\n  \\nThey passed this way  \\nthe day before yesterday.  \\n  \\nThey met someone they did not expect.  \\n  \\nDoes that comfort you?  \\n  \\nWho are you?  \\n  \\nShow yourself!  \\n  \\nIt cannot be.  \\n  \\nForgive me.  \\n  \\nI mistook you for Saruman.  \\n  \\nI am Saruman.  \\n  \\nOr rather, Saruman  \\nas he should have been.  \\n  \\nYou fell.  \\n  \\nThrough fire...  \\n  \\n...and water.  \\n  \\nFrom the lowest dungeon  \\nto the highest peak...  \\n  \\n...I fought with the Balrog  \\nof Morgoth.  \\n  \\nUntil at last I threw down  \\nmy enemy...  \\n  \\n...and smote his ruin  \\nupon the mountainside.  \\n  \\nDarkness took me...  \\n  \\n...and I strayed out of thought  \\nand time.  \\n  \\nStars wheeled overhead...  \\n  \\n...and every day was as long  \\nas a life age of the Earth.  \\n  \\nBut it was not the end.  \\n  \\nI felt life in me again.  \\n  \\nI\\'ve been sent back...  \\n  \\n...until my task is done.  \\n  \\nGandalf.  \\n  \\nGandalf?  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nThat was what they used to call me.  \\n  \\nGandalf the Grey.  \\n  \\nThat was my name.  \\n  \\nGandalf.  \\n  \\nI am Gandalf the White.  \\n  \\nAnd I come back to you now...  \\n  \\n...at the turn of the tide.  \\n  \\nOne stage of your journey is over.  \\nAnother begins.  \\n  \\n\\\\- We must travel to Edoras with all speed.  \\n\\\\- Edoras?  \\n  \\nThat is no short distance!  \\n  \\nWe hear of trouble in Rohan.  \\nIt goes ill with the king.  \\n  \\nYes, and it will not be easily cured.  \\n  \\nThen we have run all this way for nothing?  \\n  \\nAre we to leave those poor Hobbits here...  \\n  \\n...in this horrid, dark, dank tree-infested-?  \\n  \\nI mean, charming...  \\n  \\n...quite charming forest.  \\n  \\nIt was more than mere chance that  \\nbrought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn.  \\n  \\nA great power has been sleeping here  \\nfor many long years.  \\n  \\nThe coming of Merry and Pippin  \\nwill be like the falling of small stones...  \\n  \\n...that starts an avalanche  \\nin the mountains.  \\n  \\nIn one thing you have not changed,  \\ndear friend.  \\n  \\nYou still speak in riddles.  \\n  \\nA thing is about to happen that has not  \\nhappened since the Elder Days.  \\n  \\nThe Ents are going to wake up...  \\n  \\n\\\\- ... and find that they are strong.  \\n\\\\- Strong?!  \\n  \\nOh, that\\'s good.  \\n  \\nSo stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.  \\n  \\nMerry and Pippin are quite safe.  \\n  \\nIn fact, they are far safer  \\nthan you are about to be.  \\n  \\nThis new Gandalf\\'s more grumpy  \\nthan the old one.  \\n  \\nThat is one of the Mearas...  \\n  \\n...unless my eyes are cheated  \\nby some spell.  \\n  \\nShadowfax.  \\n  \\nHe is the lord of all horses...  \\n  \\n...and has been my friend  \\nthrough many dangers.  \\n  \\nO rowan mine  \\n  \\nI saw you shine  \\n  \\nUpon a summer\\'s day  \\n  \\nUpon your head  \\nHow golden-red  \\n  \\nThe crown you bore aloft  \\n  \\nSuch a beautiful verse.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Is it much further?  \\n\\\\- Bru-ra-hroom. Don\\'t be hasty.  \\n  \\nYou might call it far, perhaps.  \\n  \\nMy home lies deep in the forest...  \\n  \\n...near the roots of the mountain.  \\n  \\nI told Gandalf I would keep you safe.  \\n  \\nAnd safe is where I\\'ll keep you.  \\n  \\nI believe you will enjoy this next one too.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s one of my own compositions.  \\n  \\nRight.  \\n  \\nBeneath the roof of sleeping leaves  \\n  \\nAnd the dreams of trees unfold  \\n  \\nWhen woodland halls are green and cool  \\n  \\nAnd the wind is in the West  \\n  \\nCome back to me  \\n  \\nCome back to me  \\n  \\nAnd say my land is best  \\n  \\nSleep, little Shirelings.  \\n  \\nHeed no nightly noise.  \\n  \\nSleep till morning light.  \\n  \\nI have business in the forest.  \\n  \\nThere are many to call.  \\nMany that must come.  \\n  \\nThe Shadow lies on Fangorn.  \\n  \\nThe withering of all woods  \\nis drawing near.  \\n  \\nThe veiling shadow that glowers  \\nin the east takes shape.  \\n  \\nSauron will suffer no rival.  \\n  \\nFrom the summit of Barad-dur,  \\nhis Eye watches ceaselessly.  \\n  \\nBut he is not so mighty yet  \\nthat he is above fear.  \\n  \\nDoubt ever gnaws at him.  \\n  \\nThe rumor has reached him.  \\n  \\nThe heir of Numenor still lives.  \\n  \\nSauron fears you, Aragorn.  \\n  \\nHe fears what you may become.  \\n  \\nAnd so he\\'ll strike hard and fast  \\nat the world of Men.  \\n  \\nHe will use his puppet Saruman  \\nto destroy Rohan.  \\n  \\nWar is coming.  \\n  \\nRohan must defend itself,  \\nand therein lies our first challenge...  \\n  \\n...for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.  \\n  \\nThe king\\'s mind is enslaved,  \\nit\\'s an old device of Saruman\\'s.  \\n  \\nHis hold over King Theoden  \\nis now very strong.  \\n  \\nSauron and Saruman  \\nare tightening the noose.  \\n  \\nBut for all their cunning...  \\n  \\n...we have one advantage.  \\n  \\nThe Ring remains hidden.  \\n  \\nAnd that we should seek to destroy it...  \\n  \\n...has not yet entered  \\ntheir darkest dreams.  \\n  \\nAnd so the weapon of the enemy  \\nis moving towards Mordor...  \\n  \\n...in the hands of a Hobbit.  \\n  \\nEach day brings it closer  \\nto the fires of Mount Doom.  \\n  \\nWe must trust now in Frodo.  \\n  \\nEverything depends upon speed...  \\n  \\n...and the secrecy of his quest.  \\n  \\nDo not regret your decision to leave him.  \\n  \\nFrodo must finish this task alone.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s not alone.  \\n  \\nSam went with him.  \\n  \\nDid he?  \\n  \\nDid he, indeed? Good.  \\n  \\nYes, very good.  \\n  \\nThe Black Gate of Mordor.  \\n  \\nOh, save us.  \\n  \\nMy old Gaffer would have a thing or two  \\nto say if he could see us now.  \\n  \\nMaster says to show him  \\nthe way into Mordor.  \\n  \\nSo good Smeagol does,  \\nmaster says so.  \\n  \\nI did.  \\n  \\nThat\\'s it, then.  \\n  \\nWe can\\'t get past that.  \\n  \\nLook!  \\n  \\nThe gate.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s opening!  \\n  \\nI can see a way down.  \\n  \\nSam, no!  \\n  \\nMaster!  \\n  \\n\\\\- I do not ask you to come with me, Sam.  \\n\\\\- I know, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nI doubt even these Elvish cloaks  \\nwill hide us in there.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Now!  \\n\\\\- No!  \\n  \\nNo! No, master!  \\n  \\nThey catch you! They catch you!  \\n  \\nDon\\'t take it to him.  \\n  \\nHe wants the precious.  \\n  \\nAlways he is looking for it.  \\n  \\nAnd the precious is wanting  \\nto go back to him.  \\n  \\nBut we mustn\\'t let him have it.  \\n  \\nNo! There\\'s another way.  \\n  \\nMore secret. A dark way.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Why haven\\'t you spoken of this before?  \\n\\\\- Because master did not ask.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s up to something.  \\n  \\nAre you saying there\\'s another way  \\ninto Mordor?  \\n  \\nYes. There\\'s a path...  \\n  \\n...and some stairs.  \\n  \\nAnd then...  \\n  \\n...a tunnel.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s led us this far, Sam.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo, no.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s been true to his word.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nLead the way, Smeagol.  \\n  \\nGood Smeagol always helps.  \\n  \\nHello?  \\n  \\nTreebeard?  \\n  \\nWhere has he gone?  \\n  \\nI had the loveliest dream last night.  \\n  \\nThere was this large barrel,  \\nfull of pipe-weed.  \\n  \\nAnd we smoked all of it.  \\nAnd then...  \\n  \\n...you were sick.  \\n  \\nI\\'d give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.  \\n  \\nDid you hear that?  \\n  \\nThere it is again.  \\n  \\nSomething\\'s not right here.  \\nNot right at all.  \\n  \\nYou just said something... Treeish.  \\n  \\nNo, I didn\\'t. I was just stretching.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re taller.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Who?  \\n\\\\- You!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Than what?  \\n\\\\- Than me!  \\n  \\nI\\'ve always been taller than you.  \\n  \\nPippin, everyone knows I\\'m the tall one.  \\nYou\\'re the short one.  \\n  \\nPlease, Merry.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re what? Three-foot-six? At the most?  \\n  \\nWhereas me, I\\'m pushing 3\\'7\".  \\n  \\n3\\'8\"!  \\n  \\nThree-foot-eight.  \\n  \\nYou did something.  \\n  \\nMerry, don\\'t! Don\\'t drink it!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nNo, Treebeard said that you  \\nshouldn\\'t have any.  \\n  \\n\\\\- I want some!  \\n\\\\- It could well be dangerous!  \\n  \\nGive me it back. Merry!  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s happening?!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s got my leg!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nHelp!  \\n  \\nAway with you.  \\n  \\nYou should not be waking.  \\n  \\nEat earth. Dig deep. Drink water.  \\n  \\nGo to sleep.  \\n  \\nAway with you.  \\n  \\nCome, the forest is waking up.  \\n  \\nIt isn\\'t safe.  \\n  \\nThe trees have grown wild  \\nand dangerous.  \\n  \\nAnger festers in their hearts.  \\n  \\nBlack are their thoughts.  \\n  \\nStrong is their hate.  \\n  \\nThey will harm you if they can.  \\n  \\nThere are too few of us now.  \\n  \\nToo few of us Ents left to manage them.  \\n  \\nWhy are there so few of you  \\nwhen you have lived so long?  \\n  \\n\\\\- Are there Ent children?  \\n\\\\- Bru-ra-hroom.  \\n  \\nThere have been no Entings  \\nfor a terrible long count of years.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Why is that?  \\n\\\\- We lost the Entwives.  \\n  \\nOh, I\\'m sorry.  \\n  \\n\\\\- How did they die?  \\n\\\\- Die? No.  \\n  \\nWe lost them.  \\n  \\nAnd now we cannot find them.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t suppose you\\'ve seen Entwives  \\nin the Shire?  \\n  \\nCan\\'t say that I have.  \\n  \\nYou, Pip?  \\n  \\nWhat do they look like?  \\n  \\nI don\\'t remember now.  \\n  \\nEdoras and the Golden Hall  \\nof Meduseld.  \\n  \\nThere dwells Theoden, King of Rohan...  \\n  \\n...whose mind is overthrown.  \\n  \\nSaruman\\'s hold over King Theoden  \\nis now very strong.  \\n  \\nMy lord, your son...  \\n  \\n...he is dead.  \\n  \\nMy lord?  \\n  \\nUncle?  \\n  \\nWill you not go to him?  \\n  \\nWill you do nothing?  \\n  \\nBe careful what you say.  \\n  \\nDo not look for welcome here.  \\n  \\nOh, he must have died  \\nsometime in the night.  \\n  \\nWhat a tragedy for the king...  \\n  \\n...to lose his only son and heir.  \\n  \\nI understand.  \\nHis passing is hard to accept.  \\n  \\nEspecially now that your brother  \\nhas deserted you.  \\n  \\nLeave me alone, snake!  \\n  \\nOh, but you are alone.  \\n  \\nWho knows what you\\'ve spoken  \\nto the darkness...  \\n  \\n...in the bitter watches of the night...  \\n  \\n...when all your life seems to shrink.  \\n  \\nThe walls of your bower  \\nclosing in about you.  \\n  \\nA hutch to trammel some wild thing in.  \\n  \\nSo fair.  \\n  \\nSo cold.  \\n  \\nLike a morning of pale spring...  \\n  \\n...still clinging to winter\\'s chill.  \\n  \\nYour words are poison.  \\n  \\nYou\\'ll find more cheer in a graveyard.  \\n  \\nI cannot allow you before Theoden King  \\nso armed, Gandalf Greyhame.  \\n  \\nBy order of Grima Wormtongue.  \\n  \\nYour staff.  \\n  \\nYou would not part an old man  \\nfrom his walking stick.  \\n  \\nMy lord, Gandalf the Grey is coming.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s a herald of woe.  \\n  \\nThe courtesy of your hall  \\nis somewhat lessened of late...  \\n  \\n...Theoden King.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s not welcome.  \\n  \\nWhy should I welcome you...  \\n  \\n...Gandalf Stormcrow?  \\n  \\nA just question, my liege.  \\n  \\nLate is the hour...  \\n  \\n...in which this conjurer  \\nchooses to appear.  \\n  \\nLathspell I name him.  \\n  \\nIll news is an ill guest.  \\n  \\nBe silent. Keep your forked tongue  \\nbehind your teeth.  \\n  \\nI have not passed  \\nthrough fire and death...  \\n  \\n...to bandy crooked words  \\nwith a witless worm.  \\n  \\nHis staff.  \\n  \\nI told you to take the wizard\\'s staff.  \\n  \\nTheoden...  \\n  \\n...son of Thengel...  \\n  \\n...too long have you sat  \\nin the Shadows.  \\n  \\nI would stay still if I were you.  \\n  \\nHearken to me!  \\n  \\nI release you...  \\n  \\n...from the spell.  \\n  \\nYou have no power here...  \\n  \\n...Gandalf the Grey.  \\n  \\nI will draw you, Saruman,  \\nas poison is drawn from a wound.  \\n  \\nWait.  \\n  \\nIf I go, Theoden dies.  \\n  \\nYou did not kill me...  \\n  \\n...you will not kill him.  \\n  \\nRohan is mine.  \\n  \\nBe gone.  \\n  \\nI know your face.  \\n  \\nEowyn.  \\n  \\nEowyn.  \\n  \\nGandalf?  \\n  \\nBreathe the free air again, my friend.  \\n  \\nDark have been my dreams of late.  \\n  \\nYour fingers would remember  \\ntheir old strength better...  \\n  \\n...if they grasped your sword.  \\n  \\nI\\'ve only...  \\n  \\n...ever served you, my lord.  \\n  \\nYour leechcraft would have had me  \\ncrawling on all fours like a beast!  \\n  \\nSend me not from your sight.  \\n  \\nNo, my lord! No, my lord.  \\n  \\nLet him go.  \\n  \\nEnough blood has been spilt  \\non his account.  \\n  \\nGet out of my way!  \\n  \\nHail, Theoden King!  \\n  \\nWhere is Theodred?  \\n  \\nWhere is my son?  \\n  \\nSimbelmyne.  \\n  \\nEver has it grown on the tombs  \\nof my forebearers.  \\n  \\nNow it shall cover the grave  \\nof my son.  \\n  \\nAlas that these evil days  \\nshould be mine.  \\n  \\nThe young perish and the old linger.  \\n  \\nThat I should live...  \\n  \\n...to see the last days of my house.  \\n  \\nTheodred\\'s death  \\nwas not of your making.  \\n  \\nNo parent should have to bury  \\ntheir child.  \\n  \\nHe was strong in life.  \\n  \\nHis spirit will find its way  \\nto the halls of your fathers.  \\n  \\nThey had no warning.  \\n  \\nThey were unarmed.  \\n  \\nNow the Wild Men are moving through  \\nthe Westfold, burning as they go.  \\n  \\nRick, cot and tree.  \\n  \\nWhere is Mama?  \\n  \\nThis is but a taste of the terror  \\nthat Saruman will unleash.  \\n  \\nAll the more potent for he is driven now  \\nby fear of Sauron.  \\n  \\nRide out and meet him head on.  \\n  \\nDraw him away from your women  \\nand children.  \\n  \\nYou must fight.  \\n  \\nYou have 2000 good men riding north  \\nas we speak.  \\n  \\nEomer is loyal to you.  \\n  \\nHis men will return  \\nand fight for their king.  \\n  \\nThey will be 300 leagues from here  \\nby now.  \\n  \\nEomer cannot help us.  \\n  \\nI know what it is you want of me...  \\n  \\n...but I will not bring further death  \\nto my people.  \\n  \\nI will not risk open war.  \\n  \\nOpen war is upon you,  \\nwhether you would risk it or not.  \\n  \\nWhen last I looked...  \\n  \\n...Theoden, not Aragorn,  \\nwas king of Rohan.  \\n  \\nThen what is the king\\'s decision?  \\n  \\nBy order of the king...  \\n  \\n...the city must empty.  \\n  \\nWe make for the refuge of Helm\\'s Deep.  \\n  \\nDo not burden yourself with treasures.  \\nTake only what provisions you need.  \\n  \\nHelm\\'s Deep.  \\n  \\nThey flee to the mountains  \\nwhen they should stand and fight.  \\n  \\nWho will defend them if not their king?  \\n  \\nHe\\'s only doing what he thinks  \\nis best for his people.  \\n  \\nHelm\\'s Deep has saved them  \\nin the past.  \\n  \\nThere is no way out of that ravine.  \\nTheoden is walking into a trap.  \\n  \\nHe thinks he\\'s leading them to safety.  \\n  \\nWhat they will get is a massacre.  \\n  \\nTheoden has a strong will,  \\nbut I fear for him.  \\n  \\nI fear for the survival of Rohan.  \\n  \\nHe will need you before the end,  \\nAragorn.  \\n  \\nThe people of Rohan will need you.  \\n  \\nThe defenses have to hold.  \\n  \\nThey will hold.  \\n  \\nThe Grey Pilgrim.  \\n  \\nThat\\'s what they used to call me.  \\n  \\nThree hundred lives of Men I\\'ve walked  \\nthis earth, and now I have no time.  \\n  \\nWith luck, my search will not  \\nbe in vain.  \\n  \\nLook to my coming at first light  \\non the fifth day.  \\n  \\nAt dawn, look to the east.  \\n  \\nGo.  \\n  \\nThat horse is half mad, my lord.  \\nThere\\'s nothing you can do. Leave him.  \\n  \\nHis name is Brego.  \\n  \\nHe was my cousin\\'s horse.  \\n  \\nBrego.  \\n  \\nI have heard of the magic of Elves...  \\n  \\n...but I did not look for it  \\nin a Ranger from the North.  \\n  \\nYou speak as one of their own.  \\n  \\nI was raised in Rivendell...  \\n  \\n...for a time.  \\n  \\nTurn this fellow free.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s seen enough of war.  \\n  \\nGandalf the White.  \\n  \\nGandalf the Fool!  \\n  \\nDoes he seek to humble me  \\nwith his newfound piety?  \\n  \\nThere were three  \\nwho followed the wizard.  \\n  \\nAn Elf, a Dwarf and a Man.  \\n  \\nYou stink of horse.  \\n  \\nThe Man...  \\n  \\n\\\\- ... was he from Gondor?  \\n\\\\- No, from the North.  \\n  \\nOne of the Dunedain Rangers,  \\nI thought he was.  \\n  \\nHis cloth was poor.  \\n  \\nAnd yet he bore a strange ring.  \\n  \\nTwo serpents with emerald eyes.  \\n  \\nOne devouring,  \\nthe other crowned with golden flowers.  \\n  \\nThe Ring of Barahir.  \\n  \\nSo Gandalf Greyhame  \\nthinks he has found Isildur\\'s heir.  \\n  \\nThe lost king of Gondor.  \\nHe is a fool.  \\n  \\nThe line was broken years ago.  \\n  \\nIt matters not.  \\n  \\nThe world of Men shall fall.  \\n  \\nIt will begin at Edoras.  \\n  \\nI am ready, Gamling.  \\n  \\nBring my horse.  \\n  \\nThis is not a defeat.  \\n  \\nWe will return.  \\n  \\nWe will return.  \\n  \\nYou have some skill with a blade.  \\n  \\nWomen of this country learned long ago:  \\n  \\nThose without swords  \\ncan still die upon them.  \\n  \\nI fear neither death nor pain.  \\n  \\nWhat do you fear, my lady?  \\n  \\nA cage.  \\n  \\nTo stay behind bars until use  \\nand old age accept them.  \\n  \\nAnd all chance of valor has gone  \\nbeyond recall or desire.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re a daughter of kings...  \\n  \\n...a shieldmaiden of Rohan.  \\n  \\nI do not think that would be your fate.  \\n  \\nTheoden will not stay at Edoras.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s vulnerable. He knows this.  \\n  \\nHe will expect an attack on the city.  \\n  \\nThey will flee to Helm\\'s Deep...  \\n  \\n...the great fortress of Rohan.  \\n  \\nIt is a dangerous road to take  \\nthrough the mountains.  \\n  \\nThey will be slow.  \\n  \\nThey will have women and children  \\nwith them.  \\n  \\nSend out your Warg-riders.  \\n  \\nHey, stinker, don\\'t go getting  \\ntoo far ahead.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Why do you do that?  \\n\\\\- What?  \\n  \\nCall him names.  \\nRun him down all the time.  \\n  \\nBecause.  \\n  \\nBecause that\\'s what he is, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s naught left in him  \\nbut lies and deceit.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the Ring he wants.  \\nIt\\'s all he cares about.  \\n  \\nYou have no idea what it did to him...  \\n  \\n...what it\\'s still doing to him.  \\n  \\nI want to help him, Sam.  \\n  \\nWhy?  \\n  \\nBecause I have to believe  \\nhe can come back.  \\n  \\nYou can\\'t save him, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nWhat do you know about it?  \\nNothing!  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry, Sam. I don\\'t know  \\nwhy I said that.  \\n  \\nI do.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the Ring.  \\n  \\nYou can\\'t take your eyes off it.  \\n  \\nI\\'ve seen you.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re not eating. You barely sleep.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s taken hold of you, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\n\\\\- You have to fight it.  \\n\\\\- I know what I have to do, Sam.  \\n  \\nThe Ring was entrusted to me.  \\nIt\\'s my task.  \\n  \\nMine! My own!  \\n  \\nCan\\'t you hear yourself?  \\n  \\nDon\\'t you know who you sound like?  \\n  \\nWe wants it.  \\n  \\nWe needs it.  \\n  \\nMust have the precious.  \\n  \\nThey stole it from us.  \\n  \\nSneaky little Hobbitses.  \\n  \\nWicked. Tricksy. False.  \\n  \\nNo. Not master.  \\n  \\nYes, precious. False.  \\n  \\nThey will cheat you, hurt you, lie!  \\n  \\nMaster\\'s my friend.  \\n  \\nYou don\\'t have any friends.  \\nNobody likes you.  \\n  \\nNot listening. I\\'m not listening.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re a liar and a thief.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nMurderer.  \\n  \\nGo away.  \\n  \\nGo away?  \\n  \\nI hate you.  \\n  \\nI hate you.  \\n  \\nWhere would you be without me?  \\nGollum. Gollum.  \\n  \\nI saved us.  \\n  \\nIt was me. We survived because of me.  \\n  \\nNot anymore.  \\n  \\nWhat did you say?  \\n  \\nMaster looks after us now.  \\n  \\nWe don\\'t need you.  \\n  \\nWhat?  \\n  \\nLeave now...  \\n  \\n...and never come back.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nLeave now and never come back.  \\n  \\nLeave now and never come back!  \\n  \\nWe told him to go away.  \\n  \\nAnd away he goes, precious.  \\n  \\nGone! Gone! Gone!  \\n  \\nSmeagol is free!  \\n  \\nLook.  \\n  \\nLook. See what Smeagol finds?  \\n  \\nThey are young.  \\n  \\nThey are tender. They are nice.  \\n  \\nYes, they are. Eat them. Eat them!  \\n  \\nYou\\'ll make him sick, you will...  \\n  \\n...behaving like that.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s only one way to eat  \\na brace of coneys.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s it doing?  \\n  \\nStupid, fat Hobbit.  \\n  \\nIt ruins it.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s to ruin? There\\'s hardly any meat  \\non them.  \\n  \\nWhat we need is a few good taters.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s taters, precious?  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s taters? Eh?  \\n  \\nPo-ta-toes.  \\n  \\nBoil them, mash them,  \\nstick them in a stew.  \\n  \\nLovely, big, golden chips  \\nwith a nice piece of fried fish.  \\n  \\nEven you couldn\\'t say no to that.  \\n  \\nOh, yes, we could.  \\n  \\nSpoil a nice fish.  \\n  \\nGive it to us raw...  \\n  \\n...and wriggling.  \\n  \\nYou keep nasty chips.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re hopeless.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo?  \\n  \\n\\\\- Who are they?  \\n\\\\- Wicked Men.  \\n  \\nServants of Sauron.  \\n  \\nThey are called to Mordor.  \\n  \\nThe Dark One is gathering all armies  \\nto him.  \\n  \\nIt won\\'t be long now.  \\nHe will soon be ready.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Ready to do what?  \\n\\\\- To make his war.  \\n  \\nThe last war that will cover  \\nall the world in Shadow.  \\n  \\nWe\\'ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nLook.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s an oliphaunt.  \\n  \\nNo one at home will believe this.  \\n  \\nSmeagol?  \\n  \\nWe\\'ve lingered here too long.  \\n  \\nCome on, Sam.  \\n  \\nWait! We\\'re innocent travelers!  \\n  \\nThere are no travelers in this land.  \\nOnly servants of the Dark Tower.  \\n  \\nWe are bound to an errand of secrecy.  \\n  \\nThose that claim to oppose the enemy  \\nwould do well not to hinder us.  \\n  \\nThe enemy?  \\n  \\nHis sense of duty was no less  \\nthan yours, I deem.  \\n  \\nYou wonder what his name is...  \\n  \\n...where he came from.  \\n  \\nAnd if he was really evil at heart.  \\n  \\nWhat lies or threats led him  \\non this long march from home.  \\n  \\nIf he would not rather have stayed there...  \\n  \\n...in peace.  \\n  \\nWar will make corpses of us all.  \\n  \\nBind their hands.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s true, you don\\'t see  \\nmany Dwarf women.  \\n  \\nAnd in fact, they are so alike  \\nin voice and appearance...  \\n  \\n...that they\\'re often mistaken  \\nfor Dwarf men.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the beards.  \\n  \\nThis, in turn, has given rise  \\nto the belief...  \\n  \\n...that there are no Dwarf women...  \\n  \\n...and that Dwarves just spring out  \\nof holes in the ground...  \\n  \\n...which is, of course, ridiculous.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s all right. Nobody panic.  \\n  \\nThat was deliberate.  \\nIt was deliberate.  \\n  \\nI haven\\'t seen my niece smile  \\nfor a long time.  \\n  \\nShe was a girl when they brought  \\nher father back dead.  \\n  \\nCut down by Orcs.  \\n  \\nShe watched her mother  \\nsuccumb to grief.  \\n  \\nThen she was left alone,  \\nto tend her king in growing fear.  \\n  \\nDoomed to wait upon an old man  \\nwho should have loved her as a father.  \\n  \\nGimli.  \\n  \\nNo, I couldn\\'t  \\n  \\nI really couldn\\'t.  \\n  \\nI made some stew.  \\n  \\nIt isn\\'t much, but it\\'s hot.  \\n  \\nThank you.  \\n  \\n\\\\- It\\'s good.  \\n\\\\- Really?  \\n  \\nMy uncle told me a strange thing.  \\n  \\nHe said that you rode to war  \\nwith Thengel, my grandfather.  \\n  \\nBut he must be mistaken.  \\n  \\nKing Theoden has a good memory.  \\nHe was only a small child at the time.  \\n  \\nThen you must be at least 60.  \\n  \\nSeventy?  \\n  \\nBut you cannot be 80!  \\n  \\nEighty-seven.  \\n  \\nYou are one of the Dunedain.  \\n  \\nA descendant of Numenor,  \\nblessed with long life.  \\n  \\nIt was said that your race  \\nhad passed into legend.  \\n  \\nThere are few of us left.  \\n  \\nThe Northern Kingdom  \\nwas destroyed long ago.  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry. Please, eat.  \\n  \\nThe light of the Evenstar  \\ndoes not wax and wane.  \\n  \\nIt is mine to give to whom I will.  \\n  \\nLike my heart.  \\n  \\nGo to sleep.  \\n  \\nI am asleep.  \\n  \\nThis is a dream.  \\n  \\nThen it is a good dream.  \\n  \\nSleep.  \\n  \\nArwen...  \\n  \\nWhere is she?  \\n  \\nThe woman who gave you that jewel.  \\n  \\nOur time here is ending.  \\n  \\nArwen\\'s time is ending.  \\n  \\nLet her go.  \\n  \\nLet her take the ship into the west.  \\n  \\nLet her bear away her love for you  \\nto the Undying Lands.  \\n  \\nThere it will be ever green.  \\n  \\nBut never more than memory.  \\n  \\nI will not leave my daughter here  \\nto die.  \\n  \\n\\\\- She stays because she still has hope.  \\n\\\\- She stays for you.  \\n  \\nShe belongs with her people.  \\n  \\nWhy are you saying this?  \\n  \\nI am mortal. You are Elf-kind.  \\n  \\nIt was a dream, Arwen.  \\n  \\nNothing more.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t believe you.  \\n  \\nThis belongs to you.  \\n  \\nIt was a gift.  \\n  \\nKeep it.  \\n  \\nMy lord?  \\n  \\nShe is sailing to the Undying Lands  \\nwith all that is left of her kin.  \\n  \\nWhat is it?  \\n  \\n\\\\- Hama?  \\n\\\\- I\\'m not sure.  \\n  \\nWargs!  \\n  \\nA scout!  \\n  \\n\\\\- What is it? What do you see?  \\n\\\\- Warg! We\\'re under attack!  \\n  \\nGet them out of here!  \\n  \\nAll riders to the head of the column.  \\n  \\nCome on. Get me up here. I\\'m a rider.  \\n  \\nCome on!  \\n  \\nYou must lead the people  \\nto Helm\\'s Deep, and make haste.  \\n  \\n\\\\- I can fight.  \\n\\\\- No!  \\n  \\nYou must do this, for me.  \\n  \\nFollow me!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Forward. I mean, charge forward.  \\n\\\\- Make for the lower ground!  \\n  \\n\\\\- That\\'s it! Go on!  \\n\\\\- Stay together!  \\n  \\nBring your pretty face to my ax.  \\n  \\nThat one counts as mine!  \\n  \\nStinking creature.  \\n  \\nAragorn!  \\n  \\nAragorn?  \\n  \\nTell me what happened  \\nand I will ease your passing.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s...  \\n  \\n...dead.  \\n  \\nHe took a little tumble off the cliff.  \\n  \\nYou lie.  \\n  \\nGet the wounded on horses.  \\n  \\nThe wolves of Isengard will return.  \\n  \\nLeave the dead.  \\n  \\nCome.  \\n  \\n\\\\- At last!  \\n\\\\- Helm\\'s Deep.  \\n  \\nThere it is, Helm\\'s Deep.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re safe!  \\n  \\nWe\\'re safe, my lady.  \\n  \\nThank you.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Mama!  \\n\\\\- Eothain!  \\n  \\nFreda!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Where is the rest?  \\n\\\\- This is all we could save, my lady.  \\n  \\nTake it to the caves.  \\n  \\nMake way for the king.  \\n  \\nMake way for Theoden.  \\nMake way for the king.  \\n  \\nSo few. So few of you have returned.  \\n  \\nOur people are safe.  \\n  \\nWe have paid for it with many lives.  \\n  \\nMy lady.  \\n  \\nLord Aragorn...  \\n  \\n...where is he?  \\n  \\nHe fell.  \\n  \\nDraw all our forces behind the wall.  \\n  \\nBar the gate.  \\nAnd set a watch on the surround.  \\n  \\nWhat of those who cannot fight, my lord?  \\nThe women and children?  \\n  \\nGet them into the caves.  \\n  \\nSaruman\\'s arm will have grown long  \\nindeed if he thinks he can reach us here.  \\n  \\nHelm\\'s Deep has one weakness.  \\n  \\nIts outer wall is solid rock...  \\n  \\n...but for a small culvert  \\nat its base...  \\n  \\n...which is little more than a drain.  \\n  \\nHow? How can fire undo stone?  \\n  \\nWhat kind of device  \\ncould bring down the wall?  \\n  \\nIf the wall is breached,  \\nHelm\\'s Deep will fall.  \\n  \\nEven if it is breached, it would take  \\na number beyond reckoning...  \\n  \\n...thousands, to storm the Keep.  \\n  \\nTens of thousands.  \\n  \\nBut, my lord, there is no such force.  \\n  \\nA new power is rising.  \\n  \\nIts victory is at hand.  \\n  \\nThis night...  \\n  \\n...the land will be stained  \\nwith the blood of Rohan!  \\n  \\nMarch to Helm\\'s Deep!  \\n  \\nLeave none alive!  \\n  \\nTo war!  \\n  \\nThere will be no dawn for Men.  \\n  \\nLook. There\\'s smoke to the south.  \\n  \\nThere is always smoke rising...  \\n  \\n...from Isengard these days.  \\n  \\nIsengard?  \\n  \\nThere was a time...  \\n  \\n...when Saruman would walk in my woods.  \\n  \\nBut now he has a mind of metal...  \\n  \\n...and wheels.  \\n  \\nHe no longer cares for growing things.  \\n  \\nWhat is it?  \\n  \\nIt\\'s Saruman\\'s army.  \\n  \\nThe war has started.  \\n  \\nMay the grace of the Valar  \\nprotect you.  \\n  \\nBrego.  \\n  \\nArwen.  \\n  \\nI have made my choice.  \\n  \\nHe is not coming back.  \\n  \\nWhy do you linger here  \\nwhen there is no hope?  \\n  \\nThere is still hope.  \\n  \\nIf Aragorn survives this war,  \\nyou will still be parted.  \\n  \\nIf Sauron is defeated  \\nand Aragorn made king...  \\n  \\n...and all that you hope for  \\ncomes true...  \\n  \\n...you will still have to taste  \\nthe bitterness of mortality.  \\n  \\nWhether by the sword  \\nor the slow decay of time...  \\n  \\n...Aragorn will die.  \\n  \\nAnd there will be no comfort  \\nfor you...  \\n  \\n...no comfort to ease the pain  \\nof his passing.  \\n  \\nHe will come to death...  \\n  \\n...an image of the splendor  \\nof the kings of Men...  \\n  \\n...in glory undimmed before  \\nthe breaking of the world.  \\n  \\nBut you, my daughter...  \\n  \\n...you will linger on in darkness  \\nand in doubt...  \\n  \\n...as nightfall in winter  \\nthat comes without a star.  \\n  \\nHere you will dwell...  \\n  \\n...bound to your grief  \\nunder the fading trees...  \\n  \\n...until all the world is changed...  \\n  \\n...and the long years of your life  \\nare utterly spent.  \\n  \\nArwen.  \\n  \\nThere is nothing for you here...  \\n  \\n...only death.  \\n  \\nThe power of the enemy is growing.  \\n  \\nSauron will use his puppet,  \\nSaruman...  \\n  \\n...to destroy the people of Rohan.  \\n  \\nIsengard has been unleashed.  \\n  \\nThe Eye of Sauron now turns  \\nto Gondor...  \\n  \\n...the last free kingdom of Men.  \\n  \\nHis war on this country  \\nwill come swiftly.  \\n  \\nHe senses the Ring is close.  \\n  \\nThe strength of the Ring-bearer  \\nis failing.  \\n  \\nIn his heart, Frodo begins  \\nto understand...  \\n  \\n...the quest will claim his life.  \\n  \\nYou know this.  \\n  \\nYou have foreseen it.  \\n  \\nIt is the risk we all took.  \\n  \\nIn the gathering dark, the will  \\nof the Ring grows strong.  \\n  \\nIt works hard now to find its way back  \\ninto the hands of Men.  \\n  \\nMen, who are so easily seduced  \\nby its power.  \\n  \\nThe young captain of Gondor  \\nhas but to extend his hand...  \\n  \\n...take the Ring for his own,  \\nand the world will fall.  \\n  \\nIt is close now.  \\n  \\nSo close to achieving its goal.  \\n  \\nFor Sauron will have dominion  \\nover all life on this Earth...  \\n  \\n...even unto to the ending  \\nof the world.  \\n  \\nThe time of the Elves...  \\n  \\n...is over.  \\n  \\nDo we leave Middle-earth  \\nto its fate?  \\n  \\nDo we let them stand alone?  \\n  \\nWhat news?  \\n  \\nOur scouts report Saruman  \\nhas attacked Rohan.  \\n  \\nTheoden\\'s people have fled  \\nto Helm\\'s Deep.  \\n  \\nBut we must look to our own borders.  \\nFaramir, Orcs are on the move.  \\n  \\nSauron is marshaling an army.  \\n  \\nEasterlings and Southrons  \\nare at the Black Gate.  \\n  \\n\\\\- How many?  \\n\\\\- Some thousands. More come every day.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Who\\'s covering the river to the north?  \\n\\\\- We pulled 500 men at Osgiliath.  \\n  \\nIf their city is attacked,  \\nwe won\\'t hold it.  \\n  \\nSaruman attacks from Isengard.  \\n  \\nSauron from Mordor.  \\n  \\nThe fight will come to Men  \\non both fronts.  \\n  \\nGondor is weak.  \\n  \\nSauron will strike us soon.  \\n  \\nAnd he will strike hard.  \\n  \\nHe knows now we do not have  \\nthe strength to repel him.  \\n  \\nMy men tell me that you are Orc spies.  \\n  \\nSpies? Now wait just a minute.  \\n  \\nWell, if you\\'re not spies,  \\nthen who are you?  \\n  \\nSpeak.  \\n  \\nWe are Hobbits of the Shire.  \\n  \\nFrodo Baggins is my name,  \\nand this is Samwise Gamgee.  \\n  \\nYour bodyguard?  \\n  \\nHis gardener.  \\n  \\nAnd where is your skulking friend?  \\n  \\nThat gangrel creature.  \\n  \\nHe had an ill-favored look.  \\n  \\nThere was no other.  \\n  \\nWe set out from Rivendell  \\nwith seven companions.  \\n  \\nOne we lost in Moria...  \\n  \\n...two were my kin...  \\n  \\n...a Dwarf there was also.  \\nAnd an Elf and two Men.  \\n  \\nAragorn, son of Arathorn,  \\nand Boromir of Gondor.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re a friend of Boromir?  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nFor my part.  \\n  \\nIt will grieve you then to learn  \\nthat he is dead.  \\n  \\nDead?  \\n  \\nHow? When?  \\n  \\nAs one of his companions,  \\nI\\'d hoped you would tell me.  \\n  \\nIf something has happened to Boromir,  \\nwe would have you tell us.  \\n  \\nHis horn washed up upon the riverbank,  \\nabout six days past.  \\n  \\nIt was cloven in two.  \\n  \\nBut more than this, I know it in my heart.  \\n  \\nHe was my brother.  \\n  \\nBoromir!  \\n  \\nBoromir!  \\n  \\nThis city was once the jewel  \\nof our kingdom.  \\n  \\nA place of light and beauty and music.  \\n  \\nAnd so it shall be once more!  \\n  \\nLet the armies of Mordor know this:  \\n  \\nNever again will the land of my people  \\nfall into enemy hands.  \\n  \\nThis city of Osgiliath  \\nhas been reclaimed for Gondor!  \\n  \\n\\\\- For Gondor!  \\n\\\\- For Gondor!  \\n  \\n\\\\- For Gondor!  \\n\\\\- For Gondor!  \\n  \\nGood speech. Nice and short.  \\n  \\nLeaves more time for drinking!  \\n  \\nBreak out the ale! These men are thirsty!  \\n  \\nRemember today, little brother.  \\n  \\nToday, life is good.  \\n  \\nWhat?  \\n  \\nHe\\'s here.  \\n  \\nOne moment of peace,  \\ncan he not give us that?  \\n  \\nWhere is he?  \\n  \\nWhere is Gondor\\'s finest?  \\nWhere\\'s my first-born?  \\n  \\nFather!  \\n  \\nThey say you vanquished the enemy  \\nalmost single-handedly.  \\n  \\nThey exaggerate.  \\nThe victory belongs to Faramir also.  \\n  \\nBut for Faramir, this city  \\nwould still be standing.  \\n  \\nWere you not entrusted to protect it?  \\n  \\nI would have done,  \\nbut our numbers were too few.  \\n  \\nOh, too few.  \\n  \\nYou let the enemy walk in  \\nand take it on a whim.  \\n  \\nAlways you cast a poor reflection on me.  \\n  \\nThat is not my intent.  \\n  \\nYou give him no credit,  \\nand yet he tries to do your will.  \\n  \\n\\\\- He loves you, Father.  \\n\\\\- Do not trouble me with Faramir...  \\n  \\n...I know his uses, and they are few.  \\n  \\nWe have more urgent things to speak of.  \\n  \\nElrond of Rivendell has called a meeting.  \\n  \\nHe will not say why,  \\nbut I have guessed its purpose.  \\n  \\nIt is rumored that the weapon  \\nof the enemy has been found.  \\n  \\nThe One Ring.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Isildur\\'s Bane.  \\n\\\\- It has fallen into the hands of the Elves.  \\n  \\nEveryone will try to claim it:  \\nMen, Dwarves, wizards.  \\n  \\nWe cannot let that happen.  \\nThis thing must come to Gondor.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Gondor.  \\n\\\\- It\\'s dangerous, I know.  \\n  \\nEver the Ring will seek to corrupt  \\nthe hearts of lesser Men.  \\n  \\nBut you, you are strong.  \\nAnd our need is great.  \\n  \\nIt is our blood which is being spilled,  \\nour people who are dying.  \\n  \\nSauron is biding his time.  \\nHe\\'s massing fresh armies.  \\n  \\nHe will return.  \\n  \\nAnd when he does,  \\nwe will be powerless to stop him.  \\n  \\nYou must go.  \\n  \\nBring me back this mighty gift.  \\n  \\nNo. My place is here with my people.  \\nNot in Rivendell.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Would you deny your own father?  \\n\\\\- If there is need to go to Rivendell...  \\n  \\n\\\\- ... send me in his stead.  \\n\\\\- You?  \\n  \\nOh, I see.  \\n  \\nA chance for Faramir, captain of Gondor,  \\nto show his quality.  \\n  \\nI think not.  \\n  \\nI trust this mission only to your brother.  \\n  \\nThe one who will not fail me.  \\n  \\nRemember today, little brother.  \\n  \\nCaptain Faramir!  \\n  \\nWe found the third one.  \\n  \\nYou must come with me. Now.  \\n  \\nDown there.  \\n  \\nTo enter the Forbidden Pool  \\nbears the penalty of death.  \\n  \\nThey wait for my command.  \\n  \\nShall I shoot?  \\n  \\nThe rock and pool  \\nIs nice and cool  \\n  \\nSo juicy sweet  \\n  \\nOur only wish  \\nTo catch a fish  \\n  \\nSo juicy sweet  \\n  \\nWait.  \\n  \\nThis creature is bound to me.  \\n  \\nAnd I to him.  \\n  \\nHe is our guide.  \\n  \\nPlease...  \\n  \\n...let me go down to him.  \\n  \\nSmeagol.  \\n  \\nMaster is here.  \\n  \\nCome, Smeagol.  \\n  \\nTrust master. Come.  \\n  \\nWe must go now?  \\n  \\nSmeagol, you must trust master.  \\n  \\nFollow me. Come on.  \\n  \\nCome.  \\n  \\nCome, Smeagol.  \\n  \\nNice Smeagol. That\\'s it.  \\n  \\nCome on.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t hurt him!  \\n  \\nSmeagol, don\\'t struggle.  \\nSmeagol, listen to me.  \\n  \\nMaster!  \\n  \\nThat\\'s enough.  \\n  \\nWhere are you leading them?  \\n  \\nAnswer me.  \\n  \\nSmeagol.  \\n  \\nWhy does it cry, Smeagol?  \\n  \\nCruel Men hurts us.  \\n  \\nMaster tricksed us.  \\n  \\nOf course he did.  \\n  \\nI told you he was tricksy.  \\n  \\nI told you he was false.  \\n  \\nMaster is our friend.  \\n  \\nOur friend.  \\n  \\nMaster betrayed us.  \\n  \\nNo. Not its business.  \\n  \\nLeave us alone!  \\n  \\nFilthy little Hobbitses!  \\n  \\nThey stole it from us!  \\n  \\nNo. No.  \\n  \\nWhat did they steal?  \\n  \\nMy precious!  \\n  \\nWe have to get out of here.  \\n  \\nYou go. Go, now.  \\n  \\nYou can do it.  \\n  \\nUse the Ring, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nJust this once.  \\n  \\nPut it on.  \\n  \\nDisappear.  \\n  \\nI can\\'t.  \\n  \\nYou were right, Sam.  \\n  \\nYou tried to tell me but...  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry.  \\n  \\nThe Ring\\'s taking me, Sam.  \\n  \\nIf I put it on...  \\n  \\n...he\\'ll find me.  \\n  \\nHe\\'ll see.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo...  \\n  \\nSo this is the answer  \\nto all the riddles.  \\n  \\nHere in the Wild I have you...  \\n  \\n...two Halflings...  \\n  \\n...and a host of men at my call.  \\n  \\nThe Ring of Power within my grasp.  \\n  \\nA chance for Faramir,  \\ncaptain of Gondor...  \\n  \\n...to show his quality.  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\nStop it!  \\n  \\nLeave him alone.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t you understand?  \\n  \\nHe\\'s got to destroy it!  \\n  \\nThat\\'s where we\\'re going, into Mordor.  \\n  \\nTo the Mountain of Fire!  \\n  \\nOsgiliath is under attack.  \\nThey call for reinforcements.  \\n  \\nPlease. It\\'s such a burden.  \\n  \\nWill you not help him?  \\n  \\nCaptain?  \\n  \\nPrepare to leave.  \\n  \\nThe Ring will go to Gondor.  \\n  \\n\\\\- He\\'s alive!  \\n\\\\- Where is he? Where is he?  \\n  \\nGet out of the way!  \\nI\\'m going to kill him!  \\n  \\nYou are the luckiest, the canniest...  \\n  \\n...and the most reckless man  \\nI ever knew.  \\n  \\nBless you, laddie.  \\n  \\nGimli, where is the king?  \\n  \\nYou look terrible.  \\n  \\nA great host, you say?  \\n  \\n\\\\- All Isengard is emptied.  \\n\\\\- How many?  \\n  \\nTen thousand strong at least.  \\n  \\nTen thousand?  \\n  \\nIt is an army bred for a single purpose:  \\n  \\nTo destroy the world of Men.  \\n  \\nThey will be here by nightfall.  \\n  \\nLet them come!  \\n  \\nI want every man and strong lad  \\nable to bear arms...  \\n  \\n...to be ready for battle by nightfall.  \\n  \\nWe will cover the causeway  \\nand the gate from above.  \\n  \\nNo army has ever breached  \\nthe Deeping Wall...  \\n  \\n...or set foot inside the Hornburg!  \\n  \\nThis is no rabble of mindless Orcs.  \\n  \\nThese are Uruk-hai.  \\n  \\nTheir armour is thick  \\nand their shields broad.  \\n  \\nI have fought many wars,  \\nMaster Dwarf.  \\n  \\nI know how to defend my own keep.  \\n  \\nThey will break upon this fortress  \\nlike water on rock.  \\n  \\nSaruman\\'s hordes will pillage and burn.  \\nWe\\'ve seen it before.  \\n  \\nCrops can be resown...  \\n  \\n...homes rebuilt.  \\n  \\nWithin these walls...  \\n  \\n...we will outlast them.  \\n  \\nThey do not come to destroy Rohan\\'s  \\ncrops or villages.  \\n  \\nThey come to destroy its people...  \\n  \\n...down to the last child.  \\n  \\nWhat would you have me do?  \\n  \\nLook at my men.  \\n  \\nTheir courage hangs by a thread.  \\n  \\nIf this is to be our end, then I would  \\nhave them make such an end...  \\n  \\n...as to be worthy of remembrance.  \\n  \\nSend out riders, my lord.  \\n  \\nYou must call for aid.  \\n  \\nAnd who will come?  \\n  \\nElves?  \\n  \\nDwarves?  \\n  \\nWe are not so lucky in our friends  \\nas you.  \\n  \\nThe old alliances are dead.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Gondor will answer.  \\n\\\\- Gondor?!  \\n  \\nWhere was Gondor  \\nwhen the Westfold fell?!  \\n  \\nWhere was Gondor when  \\nour enemies closed in around us?!  \\n  \\nWhere was Gon-?  \\n  \\nNo, my Lord Aragorn...  \\n  \\n...we are alone.  \\n  \\nGet the women and children  \\ninto the caves.  \\n  \\nWe need more time  \\nto lay provisions-  \\n  \\nThere is no time. War is upon us.  \\n  \\nSecure the gate.  \\n  \\nWe Ents have not troubled...  \\n  \\n...about the wars of Men and wizards...  \\n  \\n...for a very long time.  \\n  \\nBut now, something  \\nis about to happen...  \\n  \\n...that has not happened...  \\n  \\n...for an age.  \\n  \\nEntmoot.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s that?  \\n  \\n\\'Tis a gathering.  \\n  \\nA gathering of what?  \\n  \\nBeech. Oak.  \\n  \\nChestnut. Ash.  \\n  \\nGood. Good. Good.  \\n  \\nMany have come.  \\n  \\nNow we must decide  \\nif the Ents...  \\n  \\n...will go to war.  \\n  \\nMove back! Move to the caves!  \\n  \\nCome on, people! Quickly, now!  \\n  \\nWe\\'ll place the reserves along the wall.  \\n  \\nThey can support the archers  \\nfrom above the gate.  \\n  \\nAragorn, you must rest.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re no use to us half alive.  \\n  \\nAragorn!  \\n  \\nI\\'m to be sent with the women  \\ninto the caves.  \\n  \\nThat is an honorable charge.  \\n  \\nTo mind the children, to find food  \\nand bedding when the men return.  \\n  \\nWhat renown is there in that?  \\n  \\nMy lady, a time may come for valor  \\nwithout renown.  \\n  \\nWho then will your people look to  \\nin the last defense?  \\n  \\n\\\\- Let me stand at your side.  \\n\\\\- It is not in my power to command it.  \\n  \\nYou do not command  \\nthe others to stay!  \\n  \\nThey fight beside you because they  \\nwould not be parted from you.  \\n  \\nBecause they love you.  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry.  \\n  \\nFarmers, farriers, stable boys.  \\n  \\nThese are no soldiers.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Most have seen too many winters.  \\n\\\\- Or too few.  \\n  \\nLook at them. They\\'re frightened.  \\n  \\nI can see it in their eyes.  \\n  \\nThen I shall die as one of them!  \\n  \\nLet him go, lad.  \\n  \\nLet him be.  \\n  \\nEvery villager able to wield a sword  \\nhas been sent to the armoury.  \\n  \\nMy lord?  \\n  \\nWho am I, Gamling?  \\n  \\nYou are our king, sire.  \\n  \\nAnd do you trust your king?  \\n  \\nYour men, my lord...  \\n  \\n...will follow you to whatever end.  \\n  \\nTo whatever end.  \\n  \\nWhere is the horse and the rider?  \\n  \\nWhere is the horn that was blowing?  \\n  \\nThey have passed like rain  \\non the mountains.  \\n  \\nLike wind in the meadow.  \\n  \\nThe days have gone down in the West...  \\n  \\n...behind the hills...  \\n  \\n...into Shadow.  \\n  \\nHow did it come to this?  \\n  \\nIt\\'s been going for hours.  \\n  \\nThey must have decided something  \\nby now.  \\n  \\nDecided? No.  \\n  \\nWe only just finished saying...  \\n  \\n...good morning.  \\n  \\nBut it\\'s nighttime already.  \\n  \\nYou can\\'t take forever.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t be hasty.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re running out of time!  \\n  \\nMove! Move to the outer wall.  \\n  \\nGive me your sword.  \\n  \\nWhat is your name?  \\n  \\nHaleth, son of Hama, my lord.  \\n  \\nThe men are saying  \\nwe will not live out the night.  \\n  \\nThey say that it is hopeless.  \\n  \\nThis is a good sword.  \\n  \\nHaleth, son of Hama...  \\n  \\n...there is always hope.  \\n  \\nWe have trusted you this far.  \\nYou have not led us astray.  \\n  \\nForgive me.  \\n  \\nI was wrong to despair.  \\n  \\nWe had time, I\\'d get this adjusted.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s a little tight across the chest.  \\n  \\nThat is no Orc horn.  \\n  \\nSend for the king.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Open the gate!  \\n\\\\- Open up the gate!  \\n  \\nHow is this possible?  \\n  \\nI bring word from Elrond of Rivendell.  \\n  \\nAn alliance once existed  \\nbetween Elves and Men.  \\n  \\nLong ago we fought and died together.  \\n  \\nWe come to honor that allegiance.  \\n  \\nYou are most welcome.  \\n  \\nWe are proud to fight  \\nalongside Men once more.  \\n  \\nYou could have picked a better spot.  \\n  \\nWell, lad, whatever luck you live by,  \\nlet\\'s hope it lasts the night.  \\n  \\nYour friends are with you, Aragorn.  \\n  \\nLet\\'s hope they last the night.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What\\'s happening out there?  \\n\\\\- Shall I describe it to you?  \\n  \\nOr would you like me to find you a box?  \\n  \\nSo it begins.  \\n  \\nDid they hit anything?  \\n  \\nGive them a volley.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Fire!  \\n\\\\- Fire!  \\n  \\nSend them to me! Come on!  \\n  \\nGood!  \\n  \\nSwords! Swords!  \\n  \\nLegolas! Two already!  \\n  \\nI\\'m on 17!  \\n  \\nI\\'ll have no pointy-ear outscoring me!  \\n  \\nNineteen!  \\n  \\nMerry.  \\n  \\nWe have just agreed.  \\n  \\nYes?  \\n  \\nI have told your names to the Entmoot...  \\n  \\n...and we have agreed...  \\n  \\n...you are not Orcs.  \\n  \\nWell, that\\'s good news.  \\n  \\nAnd what about Saruman?  \\nHave you come to a decision about him?  \\n  \\nNow, don\\'t be hasty, Master Meriadoc.  \\n  \\nHasty?  \\n  \\nOur friends are out there.  \\n  \\nThey need our help. They cannot  \\nfight this war on their own.  \\n  \\nWar? Yes.  \\n  \\nIt affects us all.  \\n  \\nTree, root and twig.  \\n  \\nBut you must understand, young Hobbit...  \\n  \\n...it takes a long time...  \\n  \\n...to say anything in Old Entish...  \\n  \\n...and we never say anything...  \\n  \\n...unless it is worth taking...  \\n  \\n...a long time to say.  \\n  \\nSeventeen! Eighteen!  \\n  \\nNineteen!  \\n  \\nTwenty!  \\n  \\nTwenty-one!  \\n  \\nCauseway!  \\n  \\nIs this it?  \\n  \\nIs this is all you can conjure, Saruman?  \\n  \\nBrace the gate!  \\n  \\nHold them! Stand firm!  \\n  \\nAragorn!  \\n  \\nGimli!  \\n  \\nThe Ents cannot hold back this storm.  \\n  \\nWe must weather such things  \\nas we have always done.  \\n  \\nHow can that be your decision?!  \\n  \\nThis is not our war.  \\n  \\nBut you\\'re part of this world!  \\n  \\nAren\\'t you?!  \\n  \\nYou must help. Please.  \\n  \\nYou must do something.  \\n  \\nYou are young and brave, Master Merry.  \\n  \\nBut your part in this tale is over.  \\n  \\nGo back to your home.  \\n  \\nMaybe Treebeard\\'s right.  \\n  \\nWe don\\'t belong here, Merry.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s too big for us.  \\n  \\nWhat can we do in the end?  \\n  \\nWe\\'ve got the Shire.  \\n  \\nMaybe we should go home.  \\n  \\nThe fires of Isengard will spread...  \\n  \\n...and the woods of Tuckborough  \\nand Buckland will burn.  \\n  \\nAnd...  \\n  \\nAnd all that was once green and good  \\nin this world will be gone.  \\n  \\nThere won\\'t be a Shire, Pippin.  \\n  \\nAragorn!  \\n  \\nFall back to the Keep!  \\n  \\nGet your men out of there!  \\n  \\nHaldir!  \\n  \\nWhat are you doing?  \\nWhat are you stopping for?  \\n  \\nHaldir!  \\n  \\nBrace the gate!  \\n  \\nHold them!  \\n  \\nTo the gate. Draw your swords!  \\n  \\nMake way!  \\n  \\nWe cannot hold much longer!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Hold them!  \\n\\\\- How long do you need?  \\n  \\nAs long as you can give me.  \\n  \\nGimli!  \\n  \\nTimbers!  \\n  \\nBrace the gate!  \\n  \\nCome on. We can take them.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s a long way.  \\n  \\nToss me.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What?  \\n\\\\- I cannot jump the distance!  \\n  \\nYou\\'ll have to toss me!  \\n  \\nDon\\'t tell the Elf.  \\n  \\nNot a word.  \\n  \\nShore up the door!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Make way!  \\n\\\\- Follow me to the barricade.  \\n  \\nWatch our backs!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Throw another one over here!  \\n\\\\- Higher!  \\n  \\nHold fast the gate!  \\n  \\nGimli! Aragorn!  \\nGet out of there!  \\n  \\nAragorn!  \\n  \\nPull everybody back.  \\n  \\nPull them back.  \\n  \\nFall back!  \\n  \\nFall back!  \\n  \\nThey have broken through!  \\n  \\nThe castle is breached. Retreat!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Fall back!  \\n\\\\- Retreat!  \\n  \\nHurry! Inside. Get them inside!  \\n  \\nInto the Keep!  \\n  \\nI will leave you at the western borders  \\nof the forest.  \\n  \\nYou can make your way north  \\nto your homeland from there.  \\n  \\nWait! Stop!  \\n  \\nStop!  \\n  \\nTurn around.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Turn around. Take us south.  \\n\\\\- South?  \\n  \\nBut that will lead you past Isengard.  \\n  \\nYes. Exactly.  \\n  \\nIf we go south, we can slip  \\npast Saruman unnoticed.  \\n  \\nThe closer we are to danger,  \\nthe farther we are from harm.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the last thing he\\'ll expect.  \\n  \\nThat doesn\\'t make sense to me.  \\n  \\nBut then...  \\n  \\n...you are very small.  \\n  \\nPerhaps you\\'re right.  \\n  \\nSouth it is, then.  \\n  \\nHold on, little Shirelings.  \\n  \\nI always like going south.  \\n  \\nSomehow it feels like going downhill.  \\n  \\nAre you mad? We\\'ll be caught.  \\n  \\nNo, we won\\'t.  \\n  \\nNot this time.  \\n  \\nLook!  \\n  \\nOsgiliath burns!  \\n  \\nMordor has come.  \\n  \\nThe Ring will not save Gondor.  \\n  \\nIt has only the power to destroy.  \\n  \\nPlease...  \\n  \\n...let me go.  \\n  \\nHurry.  \\n  \\nFaramir!  \\n  \\nYou must let me go!  \\n  \\nAnd those little family of field mice...  \\n  \\n...that climb up sometimes,  \\nand they tickle me awfully.  \\n  \\nThey\\'re always trying to get somewhere  \\nwhere they...  \\n  \\nMany of these trees were my friends.  \\n  \\nCreatures I had known  \\nfrom nut and acorn.  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry, Treebeard.  \\n  \\nThey had voices of their own.  \\n  \\nSaruman.  \\n  \\nA wizard should know better!  \\n  \\nThere is no curse in Elvish...  \\n  \\n...Entish or the tongues of Men...  \\n  \\n...for this treachery.  \\n  \\nLook! The trees! They\\'re moving!  \\n  \\nWhere are they going?  \\n  \\nThey have business with the Orcs.  \\n  \\nMy business is with Isengard tonight...  \\n  \\n...with rock and stone.  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nCome, my friends.  \\n  \\nThe Ents are going to war.  \\n  \\nIt is likely...  \\n  \\n...that we go to our doom.  \\n  \\nLast march...  \\n  \\n...of the Ents.  \\n  \\nFaramir! Orcs have taken the eastern  \\nshore. Their numbers are too great.  \\n  \\nBy nightfall we will be overrun.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo?  \\n  \\nIt\\'s calling to him, Sam.  \\nHis Eye is almost on me.  \\n  \\nHold on, Mr. Frodo.  \\nYou\\'ll be all right.  \\n  \\nTake them to my father.  \\n  \\nTell him Faramir sends a mighty gift.  \\n  \\nA weapon that will change our fortunes  \\nin this war.  \\n  \\nDo you want to know  \\nwhat happened to Boromir?  \\n  \\nYou want to know  \\nwhy your brother died?  \\n  \\nHe tried to take the Ring from Frodo  \\nafter swearing an oath to protect him!  \\n  \\nHe tried to kill him!  \\n  \\nThe Ring drove your brother mad!  \\n  \\nWatch out!  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo?  \\n  \\nThey\\'re here.  \\n  \\nThey\\'ve come.  \\n  \\nNazgul!  \\n  \\nStay here. Keep out of sight.  \\n  \\nTake cover!  \\n  \\nThe fortress is taken.  \\n  \\nIt is over.  \\n  \\nYou said this fortress would never fall  \\nwhile your men defend it.  \\n  \\nThey still defend it.  \\nThey have died defending it.  \\n  \\nThey\\'re breaking in!  \\n  \\nThey\\'re past the door!  \\n  \\nIs there no other way for the women  \\nand children to get out of the caves?  \\n  \\nIs there no other way?  \\n  \\nThere is one passage.  \\nIt leads into the mountains.  \\n  \\nBut they will not get far.  \\nThe Uruk-hai are too many.  \\n  \\nTell the women and children  \\nto make for the mountain pass.  \\n  \\n\\\\- And barricade the entrance!  \\n\\\\- So much death.  \\n  \\nWhat can Men do  \\nagainst such reckless hate?  \\n  \\nRide out with me.  \\n  \\nRide out and meet them.  \\n  \\nFor death and glory.  \\n  \\nFor Rohan.  \\n  \\nFor your people.  \\n  \\nThe sun is rising.  \\n  \\nLook to my coming at first light  \\non the fifth day.  \\n  \\nAt dawn...  \\n  \\n...look to the east.  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nThe horn of Helm Hammerhand...  \\n  \\n...shall sound in the Deep...  \\n  \\n...one last time.  \\n  \\nYes!  \\n  \\nLet this be the hour  \\nwhen we draw swords together.  \\n  \\nFell deeds, awake.  \\n  \\nNow for wrath...  \\n  \\n...now for ruin and a red dawn.  \\n  \\nForth Eorlingas!  \\n  \\nGandalf.  \\n  \\nTheoden King stands alone.  \\n  \\nNot alone.  \\n  \\nRohirrim!  \\n  \\nEomer.  \\n  \\nTo the king!  \\n  \\nYes!  \\n  \\nA hit. A fine hit.  \\n  \\nBreak the dam!  \\n  \\nRelease the river!  \\n  \\nPippin! Hold on!  \\n  \\nHold on, little Hobbits.  \\n  \\nWhat are you doing?  \\n  \\nWhere are you going?  \\n  \\nIt\\'s me.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s your Sam.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t you know your Sam?  \\n  \\nI can\\'t do this, Sam.  \\n  \\nI know.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s all wrong.  \\n  \\nBy rights, we shouldn\\'t even be here.  \\n  \\nBut we are.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nThe ones that really mattered.  \\n  \\nFull of darkness and danger they were.  \\n  \\nAnd sometimes you didn\\'t want  \\nto know the end...  \\n  \\n...because how could the end be happy?  \\n  \\nHow could the world go back  \\nto the way it was...  \\n  \\n...when so much bad had happened?  \\n  \\nVictory!  \\n  \\nWe have victory!  \\n  \\nBut in the end,  \\nit\\'s only a passing thing...  \\n  \\n...this shadow.  \\n  \\nEven darkness must pass.  \\n  \\nA new day will come.  \\n  \\nAnd when the sun shines,  \\nit will shine out the clearer.  \\n  \\nThose were the stories  \\nthat stayed with you...  \\n  \\n...that meant something.  \\n  \\nEven if you were too small  \\nto understand why.  \\n  \\nBut I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.  \\n  \\nI know now.  \\n  \\nFolk in those stories...  \\n  \\n...had lots of chances of turning back,  \\nonly they didn\\'t.  \\n  \\nThey kept going...  \\n  \\n...because they were holding  \\non to something.  \\n  \\nWhat are we holding on to, Sam?  \\n  \\nThat there\\'s some good  \\nin this world, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nAnd it\\'s worth fighting for.  \\n  \\nI think at last we understand one another,  \\nFrodo Baggins.  \\n  \\nYou know the laws of our country,  \\nthe laws of your father.  \\n  \\nIf you let them go,  \\nyour life will be forfeit.  \\n  \\nThen it is forfeit.  \\n  \\nRelease them.  \\n  \\nStay out of the forest!  \\n  \\nKeep away from the trees!  \\n  \\nFinal count...  \\n  \\n\\\\- ... 42.  \\n\\\\- Forty-two?  \\n  \\nThat\\'s not bad for a pointy-eared  \\nElvish princeling.  \\n  \\nI myself am sitting pretty on 43.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Forty-three.  \\n\\\\- He was already dead.  \\n  \\n\\\\- He was twitching.  \\n\\\\- He was twitching...  \\n  \\n...because he\\'s got my ax  \\nembedded in his nervous system!  \\n  \\n\\\\- He doesn\\'t look too happy, does he?  \\n\\\\- Not too happy at all, Merry.  \\n  \\nStill, I suppose the view  \\nwould be quite nice from up there.  \\n  \\nOh, yes. It\\'s a quality establishment.  \\n  \\nI hear the staff are very good.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What are you doing?  \\n\\\\- Nothing.  \\n  \\n\\\\- The world\\'s back to normal, that\\'s all.  \\n\\\\- No, it isn\\'t.  \\n  \\nI\\'m starving.  \\n  \\nGood luck trying to find something  \\ndecent around here.  \\n  \\nProbably dead rats and moldy bread.  \\n  \\nSaruman\\'s storeroom!  \\n  \\nI don\\'t believe it.  \\n  \\nIt can\\'t be.  \\n  \\n\\\\- It is!  \\n\\\\- Longbottom Leaf.  \\n  \\nThe finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s perfect. One barrel each.  \\n  \\nWait.  \\n  \\nDo you think we should share it  \\nwith Treebeard?  \\n  \\nShare it?  \\n  \\nNo. No.  \\n  \\nDead plant and all that.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t think he\\'d understand.  \\n  \\nCould be a distant relative.  \\n  \\nI get it.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t be hasty.  \\n  \\nExactly.  \\n  \\nBar-hrum.  \\n  \\nThis is the old sewer.  \\n  \\nRuns right under the river  \\nthrough to the edge of the city.  \\n  \\nYou\\'ll find cover in the woods there.  \\n  \\nCaptain Faramir...  \\n  \\n...you have shown your quality, sir.  \\n  \\nThe very highest.  \\n  \\nThe Shire must truly be a great realm,  \\nMaster Gamgee...  \\n  \\n...where gardeners are held in high honor.  \\n  \\nWhat road will you take  \\nonce you reach the woods?  \\n  \\nGollum says there\\'s a path...  \\n  \\n...near Minas Morgul  \\nthat climbs up into the mountains.  \\n  \\nCirith Ungol?  \\n  \\n\\\\- Is that its name?  \\n\\\\- No.  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Yes.  \\n\\\\- Frodo...  \\n  \\n...they say a dark terror dwells  \\nin the passes above Minas Morgul.  \\n  \\n\\\\- You cannot go that way.  \\n\\\\- It is the only way.  \\n  \\nMaster says we must go to Mordor,  \\nso we must try.  \\n  \\nI must.  \\n  \\nGo, Frodo.  \\nGo with the goodwill of all Men.  \\n  \\nThank you.  \\n  \\nMay death find you quickly  \\nif you bring them to harm.  \\n  \\nCome on, keep up.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo didn\\'t mean for them Rangers  \\nto hurt you.  \\n  \\nYou know that, don\\'t you?  \\n  \\nHe was trying to save you, see?  \\n  \\nSave me?  \\n  \\nSo there\\'s no hard feelings.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Forgive and forget.  \\n\\\\- No, no, no hard feelings.  \\n  \\nGollum, Gollum.  \\n  \\nYes, master.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Nice Hobbits.  \\n\\\\- Very decent of you.  \\n  \\nVery decent, indeed, Gollum.  \\n  \\nSauron\\'s wrath will be terrible,  \\nhis retribution swift.  \\n  \\nThe battle for Helm\\'s Deep is over.  \\n  \\nThe battle for Middle-earth  \\nis about to begin.  \\n  \\nAll our hopes now lie  \\nwith two little Hobbits...  \\n  \\n...somewhere in the wilderness.  \\n  \\nI wonder if we\\'ll ever be  \\nput into songs or tales.  \\n  \\nWhat?  \\n  \\nI wonder if people will ever say,  \\n\"Let\\'s hear about Frodo and the Ring. \"  \\n  \\nAnd they\\'ll say,  \\n\"Yes! That\\'s one of my favorite stories. \"  \\n  \\n\"Frodo was really courageous,  \\nwasn\\'t he, Dad?\"  \\n  \\n\"Yes, my boy.  \\n  \\nThe most famousest of Hobbits.  \\nAnd that\\'s saying a lot. \"  \\n  \\nWell, you\\'ve left out  \\none of the chief characters:  \\n  \\n\"Samwise the Brave. \"  \\n  \\nI want to hear more about Sam.  \\n  \\nFrodo wouldn\\'t have got far  \\nwithout Sam.  \\n  \\nNow, Mr. Frodo, you shouldn\\'t make fun.  \\nI was being serious.  \\n  \\nSo was I.  \\n  \\n\"Samwise the Brave. \"  \\n  \\nSmeagol?  \\n  \\nWe\\'re not going to wait for you.  \\nCome on.  \\n  \\nMaster.  \\n  \\nMaster looks after us.  \\n  \\nMaster wouldn\\'t hurt us.  \\n  \\nMaster broke his promise.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t ask Smeagol.  \\n  \\nPoor, poor Smeagol.  \\n  \\nMaster betrayed us.  \\n  \\nWicked.

Hobbits.  \\n\\\\- We\\'re under orders from Treebeard...  \\n  \\n...who\\'s taken over management  \\nof Isengard.  \\n  \\nYoung Master Gandalf.  \\n  \\nI\\'m glad you\\'ve come.  \\n  \\nWood and water, stock and stone  \\nI can master.  \\n  \\nBut there is a wizard to manage here...  \\n  \\n...locked in his tower.  \\n  \\nShow yourself.  \\n  \\nBe careful.  \\n  \\nEven in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.  \\n  \\nWell, let\\'s just have his head  \\nand be done with it.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nWe need him alive.  \\n  \\nWe need him to talk.  \\n  \\nYou have fought many wars  \\nand slain many men, Théoden King...  \\n  \\n...and made peace afterwards.  \\n  \\nCan we not take counsel together  \\nas we once did, my old friend?  \\n  \\nCan we not have peace, you and I?  \\n  \\nWe shall have peace.  \\n  \\nWe shall have peace...  \\n  \\n...when you answer  \\nfor the burning of the Westfold...  \\n  \\n...and the children that lie dead there!  \\n  \\nWe shall have peace  \\nwhen the lives of the soldiers...  \\n  \\n...whose bodies were hewn  \\neven as they lay dead...  \\n  \\n...against the gates of the Hornburg,  \\nare avenged!  \\n  \\nWhen you hang from a gibbet  \\nfor the sport of your own crows...  \\n  \\n...we shall have peace.  \\n  \\nGibbets and crows?  \\n  \\nDotard!  \\n  \\nWhat do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?  \\n  \\nLet me guess. The Key of Orthanc.  \\n  \\nOr perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...  \\n  \\n...along with the crowns of the seven kings  \\nand the rods of the Five Wizards!  \\n  \\nYour treachery has already cost  \\nmany lives.  \\n  \\nThousands more are now at risk.  \\n  \\nBut you could save them, Saruman.  \\n  \\nYou were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel.  \\n  \\nSo you have come here for information.  \\n  \\nI have some for you.  \\n  \\nSomething festers  \\nin the heart of Middle-earth.  \\n  \\nSomething that you have failed to see.  \\n  \\nBut the Great Eye has seen it.  \\n  \\nEven now he presses his advantage.  \\n  \\nHis attack will come soon.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re all going to die.  \\n  \\nBut you know this, don\\'t you, Gandalf?  \\n  \\nYou cannot think that this Ranger  \\nwill ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.  \\n  \\nThis exile, crept from the shadows,  \\nwill never be crowned king.  \\n  \\nGandalf does not hesitate  \\nto sacrifice those closest to him...  \\n  \\n...those he professes to love.  \\n  \\nTell me, what words of comfort  \\ndid you give the Halfling...  \\n  \\n...before you sent him to his doom?  \\n  \\nThe path that you have set him on  \\ncan only lead to death.  \\n  \\nI\\'ve heard enough!  \\n  \\nShoot him.  \\nStick an arrow in his gob.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nCome down, Saruman...  \\n  \\n\\\\- ...and your life will be spared.  \\n\\\\- Save your pity and your mercy.  \\n  \\nI have no use for it!  \\n  \\nSaruman...  \\n  \\n...your staff is broken.  \\n  \\nGríma, you need not follow him.  \\n  \\nYou were not always as you are now.  \\n  \\nYou were once a Man of Rohan.  \\n  \\nCome down.  \\n  \\nA Man of Rohan?  \\n  \\nWhat is the house of Rohan...  \\n  \\n...but a thatched barn  \\nwhere brigands drink in the reek...  \\n  \\n...and their brats roll on the floor  \\nwith the dogs?  \\n  \\nThe victory at Helm\\'s Deep does not  \\nbelong to you, Théoden Horse-master.  \\n  \\nYou are a lesser son of greater sires.  \\n  \\nGríma...  \\n  \\n...come down.  \\n  \\nBe free of him.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Free? He will never be free.  \\n\\\\- No.  \\n  \\nGet down, cur!  \\n  \\nSaruman!  \\n  \\nYou were deep in the enemy\\'s counsel.  \\n  \\nTell us what you know!  \\n  \\nYou withdraw your guard, and I will tell you  \\nwhere your doom will be decided.  \\n  \\nI will not be held prisoner here.  \\n  \\nSend word to all our allies...  \\n  \\n...and to every corner of Middle-earth  \\nthat still stands free.  \\n  \\nThe enemy moves against us.  \\nWe need to know where he will strike.  \\n  \\nThe filth of Saruman...  \\n  \\n...is washing away.  \\n  \\nTrees will come back to live here.  \\n  \\nYoung trees.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Wild trees.  \\n\\\\- Pippin!  \\n  \\nBless my bark!  \\n  \\nPeregrin Took!  \\n  \\nI\\'ll take that, my lad.  \\n  \\nQuickly, now.  \\n  \\nTonight we remember those  \\nwho gave their blood to defend this country.  \\n  \\nHail the victorious dead.  \\n  \\nHail!  \\n  \\nNo pauses.  \\n  \\n\\\\- No spills.  \\n\\\\- And no regurgitation.  \\n  \\nSo it\\'s a drinking game?  \\n  \\nLast one standing wins.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'ll we drink to? Let\\'s drink to victory!  \\n  \\nTo victory!  \\n  \\nI am happy for you.  \\n  \\nHe is an honorable man.  \\n  \\nYou are both honorable men.  \\n  \\nIt was not Théoden of Rohan  \\nwho led our people to victory.  \\n  \\nAh, don\\'t listen to me.  \\n  \\nYou are young.  \\n  \\nAnd tonight is for you.  \\n  \\nHere, here.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the Dwarves that go swimming  \\nwith little, hairy women.  \\n  \\nI feel something.  \\n  \\nA slight tingle in my fingers.  \\n  \\nI think it\\'s affecting me.  \\n  \\nWhat did I say?  \\n  \\nHe can\\'t hold his liquor.  \\n  \\nGame over.  \\n  \\nOh, you can search far and wide  \\n  \\nYou can drink the whole town dry  \\n  \\nBut you\\'ll never find a beer so brown  \\nBut you\\'ll never find a beer so brown  \\n  \\nAs the one we drink in our hometown  \\nAs the one we drink in our hometown  \\n  \\nYou can drink your fancy ales  \\nYou can drink \\'em by the flagon  \\n  \\nBut the only brew for the brave and true  \\n  \\nPippin!  \\n  \\nBut the only brew for the brave and true  \\n  \\nComes from The Green Dragon  \\n  \\nThank you! I win!  \\n  \\nNo news of Frodo?  \\n  \\nNo word. Nothing.  \\n  \\nWe have time.  \\n  \\nEvery day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.  \\n  \\nDo we know that?  \\n  \\nWhat does your heart tell you?  \\n  \\nThat Frodo is alive.  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nYes, he\\'s alive.  \\n  \\nToo risky. Too risky.  \\n  \\nThieves.  \\n  \\nThey stole it from us.  \\n  \\nKill them. Kill them. Kill them both.  \\n  \\nShh! Quiet! Mustn\\'t wake them.  \\n  \\nMustn\\'t ruin it now.  \\n  \\nBut they knows.  \\n  \\nThey knows.  \\n  \\nThey suspects us.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s it saying, my precious, my love?  \\n  \\nIs Sméagol losing his nerve?  \\n  \\nNo. Not.  \\n  \\nNever. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.  \\n  \\nSméagol wants to see them dead.  \\n  \\nAnd we will.  \\n  \\nSméagol did it once.  \\nHe can do it again.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s ours!  \\n  \\nOurs!  \\n  \\nWe must get the precious.  \\nWe must get it back.  \\n  \\nPatience! Patience, my love.  \\n  \\nFirst we must lead them to her.  \\n  \\nWe lead them to the Winding Stair.  \\n  \\nYes, the stairs. And then?  \\n  \\nUp, up, up, up,  \\nup the stairs we go...  \\n  \\n...until we come to the tunnel.  \\n  \\nAnd when they go in...  \\n  \\n...there\\'s no coming out.  \\n  \\nShe\\'s always hungry.  \\n  \\nShe always needs to feed.  \\n  \\nShe must eat.  \\n  \\nAll she gets is filthy Orcses.  \\n  \\nAnd they doesn\\'t taste very nice,  \\ndoes they, precious?  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nNot very nice at all, my love.  \\n  \\nShe hungers for sweeter meats.  \\n  \\nHobbit meat.  \\n  \\nAnd when she throws away the bones  \\nand the empty clothes...  \\n  \\n...then we will find it.  \\n  \\nAnd take it for me!  \\n  \\nFor us.  \\n  \\nYes. We meant \"for us.\"  \\n  \\nGollum. Gollum.  \\n  \\nThe precious will be ours...  \\n  \\n...once the Hobbitses are dead!  \\n  \\nYou treacherous little toad!  \\n  \\nNo! No! Master!  \\n  \\nNo, Sam! Leave him alone!  \\n  \\nI heard it from his own mouth.  \\nHe means to murder us.  \\n  \\nNever! Sméagol wouldn\\'t hurt a fly.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s a horrid, fat Hobbit...  \\n  \\n...who hates Sméagol...  \\n  \\n...and who makes up nasty lies.  \\n  \\nYou miserable little maggot!  \\nI\\'ll stove your head in!  \\n  \\nSam!  \\n  \\nCall me a liar? You\\'re a liar!  \\n  \\n\\\\- You scare him off, we\\'re lost!  \\n\\\\- I don\\'t care! I can\\'t do it, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\n\\\\- I won\\'t wait around for him to kill us!  \\n\\\\- I\\'m not sending him away.  \\n  \\nYou don\\'t see it, do you?  \\n  \\nHe\\'s a villain.  \\n  \\nWe can\\'t do this by ourselves, Sam.  \\nNot without a guide.  \\n  \\nI need you on my side.  \\n  \\nI\\'m on your side, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nI know, Sam. I know.  \\n  \\nTrust me.  \\n  \\nCome, Sméagol.  \\n  \\nWhat time is it?  \\n  \\nNot yet dawn.  \\n  \\nI dreamed I saw a great wave...  \\n  \\n...climbing over green lands  \\nand above the hills.  \\n  \\nI stood upon the brink.  \\n  \\nIt was utterly dark in the abyss  \\nbefore my feet.  \\n  \\nA light shone behind me...  \\n  \\n...but I could not turn.  \\n  \\nI could only stand there, waiting.  \\n  \\nNight changes many thoughts.  \\n  \\nSleep, Éowyn.  \\n  \\nSleep...  \\n  \\n...while you can.  \\n  \\nThe stars are veiled.  \\n  \\nSomething stirs in the east.  \\n  \\nA sleepless malice.  \\n  \\nThe Eye of the enemy is moving.  \\n  \\nWhat are you doing?  \\n  \\nPippin!  \\n  \\nPippin?  \\n  \\nPippin.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What, are you mad?  \\n\\\\- I just want to look at it.  \\n  \\nJust one more time.  \\n  \\nPut it back.  \\n  \\nPippin.  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\nPippin.  \\n  \\nHe is here.  \\n  \\nI see you.  \\n  \\nPippin!  \\n  \\nHelp! Gandalf, help!  \\n  \\nSomeone help him!  \\n  \\nPippin!  \\n  \\nFool of a Took!  \\n  \\nLook at me.  \\n  \\nGandalf, forgive me.  \\n  \\nLook at me.  \\n  \\nWhat did you see?  \\n  \\nA tree.  \\n  \\nThere was a white tree...  \\n  \\n...in a courtyard of stone.  \\n  \\nIt was dead.  \\n  \\nThe city was burning.  \\n  \\nMinas Tirith? Is that what you saw?  \\n  \\nI saw...  \\n  \\nI saw him.  \\n  \\nI could hear his voice in my head.  \\n  \\nAnd what did you tell him?  \\n  \\nSpeak!  \\n  \\nHe asked me my name.  \\nI didn\\'t answer.  \\n  \\nHe hurt me.  \\n  \\nWhat did you tell him  \\nabout Frodo and the Ring?  \\n  \\nThere was no lie in Pippin\\'s eyes.  \\n  \\nA fool...  \\n  \\n...but an honest fool he remains.  \\n  \\nHe told Sauron nothing  \\nof Frodo and the Ring.  \\n  \\nWe\\'ve been strangely fortunate.  \\n  \\nPippin saw in the palantír  \\na glimpse of the enemy\\'s plan.  \\n  \\nSauron moves to strike  \\nthe city of Minas Tirith.  \\n  \\nHis defeat at Helm\\'s Deep  \\nshowed our enemy one thing.  \\n  \\nHe knows the heir of Elendil  \\nhas come forth.  \\n  \\nMen are not as weak as he supposed.  \\n  \\nThere is courage still, strength  \\nenough perhaps to challenge him.  \\n  \\nSauron fears this.  \\n  \\nHe will not risk the peoples of  \\nMiddle-earth uniting under one banner.  \\n  \\nHe will raze Minas Tirith  \\nto the ground...  \\n  \\n...before he sees a king  \\nreturn to the throne of Men.  \\n  \\nIf the beacons of Gondor are lit,  \\nRohan must be ready for war.  \\n  \\nTell me...  \\n  \\n...why should we ride to the aid  \\nof those who did not come to ours?  \\n  \\nWhat do we owe Gondor?  \\n  \\n\\\\- I will go.  \\n\\\\- No!  \\n  \\n\\\\- They must be warned.  \\n\\\\- They will be.  \\n  \\nYou must come to Minas Tirith  \\nby another road.  \\n  \\nFollow the river.  \\nLook to the black ships.  \\n  \\nUnderstand this:  \\n  \\nThings are now in motion  \\nthat cannot be undone.  \\n  \\nI ride for Minas Tirith...  \\n  \\n...and I won\\'t be going alone.  \\n  \\nOf all the inquisitive Hobbits,  \\nPeregrin Took, you are the worst.  \\n  \\nHurry! Hurry!  \\n  \\nWhere are we going?  \\n  \\nWhy did you look?  \\n  \\nWhy do you always have to look?  \\n  \\n\\\\- I don\\'t know. I can\\'t help it.  \\n\\\\- You never can.  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry, all right?  \\n  \\n\\\\- I won\\'t do it again.  \\n\\\\- Don\\'t you understand?  \\n  \\nThe enemy thinks you have the Ring.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s going to be looking for you, Pip.  \\nThey have to get you out of here.  \\n  \\nAnd you--? You\\'re coming with me?  \\n  \\nMerry?  \\n  \\nCome on.  \\n  \\nHow far is Minas Tirith?  \\n  \\nThree days\\' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.  \\n  \\nAnd you better hope we don\\'t have  \\none of those on our tail.  \\n  \\nHere.  \\n  \\nSomething for the road.  \\n  \\nThe last of the Longbottom Leaf.  \\n  \\nI know you\\'ve run out.  \\nYou smoke too much, Pippin.  \\n  \\nBut-- But we\\'ll see each other soon.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Won\\'t we?  \\n\\\\- I don\\'t know.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t know what\\'s going to happen.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Merry.  \\n\\\\- Run, Shadowfax.  \\n  \\nShow us the meaning of haste.  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nHe\\'s always followed me...  \\n  \\n...everywhere I went...  \\n  \\n...since before we were tweens.  \\n  \\nI would get him into  \\nthe worst sort of trouble...  \\n  \\n...but I was always there to get him out.  \\n  \\nNow he\\'s gone.  \\n  \\nJust like Frodo and Sam.  \\n  \\nOne thing I have learned about Hobbits:  \\n  \\nThey\\'re a most hardy folk.  \\n  \\nFoolhardy, maybe. He\\'s a Took.  \\n  \\nTake her by the safest road.  \\n  \\nA ship lies anchored  \\nin the Grey Havens.  \\n  \\nIt waits to carry her across the sea.  \\n  \\nThe last journey of Arwen Undómiel.  \\n  \\nThere is nothing for you here...  \\n  \\n...only death.  \\n  \\nLady Arwen...  \\n  \\n...we cannot delay.  \\n  \\nMy lady!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Tell me what you have seen.  \\n\\\\- Arwen.  \\n  \\nYou have the gift of foresight.  \\n  \\nWhat did you see?  \\n  \\nI looked into your future,  \\nand I saw death.  \\n  \\nBut there is also life.  \\n  \\nYou saw there was a child.  \\nYou saw my son.  \\n  \\nThat future is almost gone.  \\n  \\nBut it is not lost.  \\n  \\nNothing is certain.  \\n  \\nSome things are certain.  \\n  \\nIf I leave him now...  \\n  \\n...I will regret it forever.  \\n  \\nIt is time.  \\n  \\nFrom the ashes a fire shall be woken  \\n  \\nA light from the shadow shall spring  \\n  \\nRenewed shall be blade that was broken  \\n  \\nThe crownless again shall be king  \\n  \\nRe-forge the sword.  \\n  \\nYour hands are cold.  \\n  \\nThe life of the Eldar is leaving you.  \\n  \\nThis was my choice.  \\n  \\nWhether by your will or not...  \\n  \\n...there is no ship now  \\nthat can bear me hence.  \\n  \\nWe\\'ve just passed  \\ninto the realm of Gondor.  \\n  \\nMinas Tirith.  \\n  \\nCity of kings.  \\n  \\nMake way!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the tree.  \\n  \\nGandalf. Gandalf.  \\n  \\nYes, the White Tree of Gondor.  \\n  \\nThe tree of the king.  \\n  \\nLord Denethor, however,  \\nis not king.  \\n  \\nHe is a steward only,  \\na caretaker of the throne.  \\n  \\nNow listen carefully.  \\nLord Denethor is Boromir\\'s father.  \\n  \\nTo give him news of his beloved son\\'s  \\ndeath would be most unwise.  \\n  \\nAnd do not mention Frodo or the Ring.  \\n  \\nAnd say nothing of Aragorn either.  \\n  \\nIn fact, it\\'s better if you  \\ndon\\'t speak at all, Peregrin Took.  \\n  \\nHail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,  \\nlord and steward of Gondor.  \\n  \\nI come with tidings in this dark hour,  \\nand with counsel.  \\n  \\nPerhaps you come to explain this.  \\n  \\nPerhaps you come to tell me  \\nwhy my son is dead.  \\n  \\nBoromir died to save us...  \\n  \\n...my kinsman and me.  \\n  \\n\\\\- He fell defending us from many foes.  \\n\\\\- Pippin.  \\n  \\nI offer you my service, such as it is...  \\n  \\n...in payment of this debt.  \\n  \\nThis is my first command to you.  \\n  \\nHow did you escape  \\nand my son did not...  \\n  \\n...so mighty a man as he was?  \\n  \\nThe mightiest man  \\nmay be slain by one arrow...  \\n  \\n...and Boromir was pierced by many.  \\n  \\nGet up.  \\n  \\nMy lord, there will be a time  \\nto grieve for Boromir...  \\n  \\n...but it is not now.  \\n  \\nWar is coming.  \\n  \\nThe enemy is on your doorstep.  \\nAs steward, you are charged...  \\n  \\n...with the defense of this city.  \\nWhere are Gondor\\'s armies?  \\n  \\nYou still have friends.  \\nYou are not alone in this fight.  \\n  \\nSend word to Théoden of Rohan.  \\nLight the beacons.  \\n  \\nYou think you are wise, Mithrandir.  \\n  \\nYet for all your subtleties,  \\nyou have not wisdom.  \\n  \\nDo you think the eyes  \\nof the White Tower are blind?  \\n  \\nI have seen more than you know.  \\n  \\nWith your left hand you would use me  \\nas a shield against Mordor.  \\n  \\nAnd with your right  \\nyou\\'d seek to supplant me.  \\n  \\nI know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.  \\n  \\nOh, yes. Word has reached my ears  \\nof this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.  \\n  \\nAnd I tell you now, I will not bow  \\nto this Ranger from the North...  \\n  \\n...last of a ragged house  \\nlong bereft of lordship.  \\n  \\nAuthority is not given to you  \\nto deny the return of the king, steward.  \\n  \\nThe rule of Gondor is mine  \\nand no other\\'s.  \\n  \\nCome.  \\n  \\nAll has turned to vain ambition.  \\n  \\nHe would even use his grief  \\nas a cloak.  \\n  \\nA thousand years  \\nthis city has stood.  \\n  \\nNow, at the whim of a madman,  \\nit will fall.  \\n  \\nAnd the White Tree,  \\nthe tree of the king...  \\n  \\n...will never bloom again.  \\n  \\nWhy are they still guarding it?  \\n  \\nThey guard it because they have hope.  \\n  \\nA faint and fading hope  \\nthat one day it will flower.  \\n  \\nThat a king will come  \\nand this city will be as it once was...  \\n  \\n...before it fell into decay.  \\n  \\nThe old wisdom borne out  \\nof the West was forsaken.  \\n  \\nKings made tombs more splendid  \\nthan the houses of the living...  \\n  \\n...and counted the old names  \\nof their descent...  \\n  \\n...dearer than the names of their sons.  \\n  \\nChildless lords sat in aged halls,  \\nmusing on heraldry...  \\n  \\n...or in high, cold towers,  \\nasking questions of the stars.  \\n  \\nAnd so the people of Gondor  \\nfell into ruin.  \\n  \\nThe line of kings failed.  \\n  \\nThe White Tree withered.  \\n  \\nThe rule of Gondor was given over  \\nto lesser men.  \\n  \\nMordor.  \\n  \\nYes, there it lies.  \\n  \\nThis city has dwelt ever  \\nin the sight of its shadow.  \\n  \\nA storm is coming.  \\n  \\nThis is not the weather of the world.  \\n  \\nThis is a device of Sauron\\'s making.  \\n  \\nA broil of fume  \\nhe sends ahead of his host.  \\n  \\nThe Orcs of Mordor  \\nhave no love of daylight...  \\n  \\n...so he covers the face of the sun...  \\n  \\n...to ease their passage  \\nalong the road to war.  \\n  \\nWhen the Shadow of Mordor  \\nreaches this city...  \\n  \\n...it will begin.  \\n  \\nWell...  \\n  \\n...Minas Tirith...  \\n  \\n...very impressive.  \\n  \\n\\\\- So where are we off to next?  \\n\\\\- Oh, it\\'s too late for that, Peregrin.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s no leaving this city.  \\n  \\nHelp must come to us.  \\n  \\nIt must be getting near teatime.  \\n  \\nLeastways, it would be in decent places  \\nwhere there is still teatime.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re not in decent places.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo?  \\n  \\nWhat is it?  \\n  \\nIt\\'s just a feeling.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t think I\\'ll be coming back.  \\n  \\nYes, you will. Of course you will.  \\n  \\nThat\\'s just morbid thinking.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re going there and back again...  \\n  \\n...just like Mr. Bilbo.  \\n  \\nYou\\'ll see.  \\n  \\nI think these lands  \\nwere once part of the kingdom of Gondor.  \\n  \\nLong ago, when there was a king.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo, look.  \\n  \\nThe king has got a crown again.  \\n  \\nCome on, Hobbits!  \\nMustn\\'t stop now. This way.  \\n  \\nSo I imagine this is just  \\na ceremonial position.  \\n  \\nI mean, they don\\'t actually expect me  \\nto do any fighting.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Do they?  \\n\\\\- You\\'re in the service of the steward now.  \\n  \\nYou\\'ll have to do as you\\'re told,  \\nPeregrin Took.  \\n  \\nRidiculous Hobbit.  \\n  \\nGuard of the Citadel.  \\n  \\nThank you.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s no more stars.  \\n  \\nIs it time?  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s so quiet.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the deep breath before the plunge.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t want to be in a battle...  \\n  \\n...but waiting on the edge of one  \\nI can\\'t escape is even worse.  \\n  \\nIs there any hope, Gandalf,  \\nfor Frodo and Sam?  \\n  \\nThere never was much hope.  \\n  \\nJust a fool\\'s hope.  \\n  \\nOur enemy is ready.  \\n  \\nHis full strength\\'s gathered.  \\n  \\nNot only Orcs, but Men as well.  \\n  \\nLegions of Haradrim from the south...  \\n  \\n...mercenaries from the coast.  \\n  \\nAll will answer Mordor\\'s call.  \\n  \\nCome on.  \\n  \\nThis will be the end of Gondor  \\nas we know it.  \\n  \\nHere the hammer stroke will fall hardest.  \\n  \\nIf the river is taken,  \\nif the garrison at Osgiliath falls...  \\n  \\n...the last defense of this city  \\nwill be gone.  \\n  \\nBut we have the White Wizard.  \\nThat\\'s got to count for something.  \\n  \\nGandalf?  \\n  \\nSauron has yet to reveal  \\nhis deadliest servant...  \\n  \\n...the one who will lead  \\nMordor\\'s armies in war.  \\n  \\nThe one they say no living man can kill.  \\n  \\nThe Witch-king of Angmar.  \\n  \\nYou\\'ve met him before.  \\n  \\nHe stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.  \\n  \\nHe is the lord of the Nazgûl...  \\n  \\n...the greatest of the Nine.  \\n  \\nMinas Morgul is his lair.  \\n  \\nThe Dead City.  \\n  \\nVery nasty place. Full of enemies.  \\n  \\nQuick. Quick.  \\n  \\nThey will see. They will see.  \\n  \\nCome away. Come away.  \\nLook, we have found it.  \\n  \\nThe way into Mordor.  \\n  \\nThe secret stair.  \\n  \\nClimb.  \\n  \\n\\\\- No, Mr. Frodo!  \\n\\\\- Not that way!  \\n  \\n\\\\- What\\'s it doing?  \\n\\\\- No.  \\n  \\n\\\\- They\\'re calling me.  \\n\\\\- No.  \\n  \\nHide! Hide!  \\n  \\nI can feel his blade.  \\n  \\nWe come to it at last.  \\n  \\nThe great battle of our time.  \\n  \\nCome away, Hobbits.  \\nWe climb. We must climb.  \\n  \\nThe board is set.  \\n  \\nThe pieces are moving.  \\n  \\nUp, up, up the stairs we go.  \\n  \\nAnd then it\\'s into the tunnel.  \\n  \\nHey, what\\'s in this tunnel?  \\n  \\nYou listen to me,  \\nand you listen good and proper.  \\n  \\nAnything happens to him,  \\nyou have me to answer to.  \\n  \\nOne sniff something\\'s not right...  \\n  \\n...one hair stands up  \\non the back of my head, it\\'s over.  \\n  \\nNo more slinker. No more stinker.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re gone. Got it?  \\n  \\nI\\'m watching you.  \\n  \\nWhat was that about?  \\n  \\nNothing. Just clearing something up.  \\n  \\nPeregrin Took, my lad,  \\nthere is a task now to be done.  \\n  \\nAnother opportunity for one  \\nof the Shire-folk to prove their great worth.  \\n  \\nYou must not fail me.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s been very quiet across the river.  \\n  \\nThe Orcs are lying low.  \\n  \\nThe garrison may have moved out.  \\n  \\nWe\\'ve sent scouts to Cair Andros.  \\n  \\nIf the Orcs attack from the north,  \\nwe\\'ll have some warning.  \\n  \\nQuiet.  \\n  \\nWe need 10 more.  \\n  \\nKill him!  \\n  \\nThey\\'re not coming from the north.  \\n  \\n\\\\- To the river. Quick. Quick.  \\n\\\\- Go. Come on.  \\n  \\nFaster.  \\n  \\nDraw swords.  \\n  \\nHold! Hold them!  \\n  \\nWhat?  \\n  \\nAmon Dîn.  \\n  \\nThe beacon.  \\nThe beacon of Amon Dîn is lit.  \\n  \\nHope is kindled.  \\n  \\nThe beacons of Minas Tirith!  \\nThe beacons are lit!  \\n  \\nGondor calls for aid.  \\n  \\nAnd Rohan will answer.  \\n  \\nMuster the Rohirrim.  \\n  \\nAssemble the army at Dunharrow.  \\n  \\nAs many men as can be found.  \\nYou have two days.  \\n  \\nOn the third,  \\nwe ride for Gondor and war.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Forward.  \\n\\\\- Very good, sir.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Gamling.  \\n\\\\- My lord.  \\n  \\nMake haste  \\nacross the Riddermark.  \\n  \\nSummon every able-bodied man  \\nto Dunharrow.  \\n  \\nI will.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Will you ride with us?  \\n\\\\- Just to the encampment.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s tradition for the women  \\nof the court to farewell the men.  \\n  \\nThe men have found their captain.  \\n  \\nThey will follow you into battle,  \\neven to death.  \\n  \\nYou have given us hope.  \\n  \\nExcuse me.  \\n  \\nI have a sword.  \\n  \\nPlease accept it.  \\n  \\nI offer you my service, Théoden King.  \\n  \\nAnd gladly I accept it.  \\n  \\nYou shall be Meriadoc,  \\nesquire of Rohan.  \\n  \\nHorse-Men.  \\n  \\nI wish I could muster a legion of Dwarves,  \\nfully armed and filthy.  \\n  \\nYour kinsmen may have no need  \\nto ride to war.  \\n  \\nI fear war already marches  \\non their own lands.  \\n  \\nSo it is before the walls  \\nof Minas Tirith...  \\n  \\n...the doom of our time will be decided.  \\n  \\nNow is the hour.  \\nRiders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.  \\n  \\nNow, fulfill them all.  \\nTo lord and land! Hyah!  \\n  \\nFaramir!  \\n  \\nWe can\\'t hold them. The city is lost.  \\n  \\nTell the men to break cover.  \\nWe ride for Minas Tirith.  \\n  \\nNazgûl.  \\n  \\nTake cover!  \\n  \\nNazgûl!  \\n  \\nFall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!  \\n  \\nFall back!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Retreat! Retreat!  \\n\\\\- Run for your lives!  \\n  \\nThe age of Men is over.  \\n  \\nThe time of the Orc has come.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Keep going.  \\n\\\\- It\\'s the Nazgûl.  \\n  \\nTake cover, my lord!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s coming!  \\n  \\n\\\\- It\\'s Mithrandir.  \\n\\\\- The White Rider!  \\n  \\nPull!  \\n  \\nMithrandir.  \\n  \\nThey broke through our defenses.  \\n  \\nThey\\'ve taken the bridge  \\nand the west bank.  \\n  \\nBattalions of Orcs are crossing the river.  \\n  \\nIt is as the Lord Denethor predicted.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Long has he foreseen this doom.  \\n\\\\- Foreseen and done nothing.  \\n  \\nFaramir?  \\n  \\nThis is not the first Halfling  \\nto have crossed your path.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nYou\\'ve seen Frodo and Sam?  \\n  \\n\\\\- Where? When?  \\n\\\\- In Ithilien.  \\n  \\nNot two days ago.  \\n  \\nGandalf, they\\'re taking the road  \\nto the Morgul Vale.  \\n  \\nAnd then the pass of Cirith Ungol.  \\n  \\nWhat does that mean?  \\n  \\n\\\\- What\\'s wrong?  \\n\\\\- Faramir, tell me everything.  \\n  \\nTell me all you know.  \\n  \\nThis is how you would serve your city?  \\n  \\nYou would risk its utter ruin?  \\n  \\nI did what I judged to be right.  \\n  \\nWhat you judged to be right.  \\n  \\nYou sent the Ring of Power into Mordor  \\nin the hands of a witless Halfling.  \\n  \\nIt should have been brought back  \\nto the Citadel to be kept safe.  \\n  \\nHidden.  \\n  \\nDark and deep in the vaults...  \\n  \\n...not to be used.  \\n  \\nUnless at the uttermost end of need.  \\n  \\nI would not use the Ring.  \\n  \\nNot if Minas Tirith were falling in ruin  \\nand I alone could save her.  \\n  \\nEver you desire to appear lordly  \\nand gracious...  \\n  \\n...as a king of old.  \\n  \\nBoromir would have remembered  \\nhis father\\'s need.  \\n  \\nHe would have brought me a kingly gift.  \\n  \\nBoromir would not  \\nhave brought the Ring.  \\n  \\nHe would have stretched out his hand to  \\nthis thing and taken it. He would\\'ve fallen.  \\n  \\n\\\\- You know nothing of this matter!  \\n\\\\- He would have kept it for his own.  \\n  \\nAnd when he returned...  \\n  \\n...you would not have known your son.  \\n  \\nBoromir was loyal to me!  \\n  \\nNot some wizard\\'s pupil!  \\n  \\nFather?  \\n  \\nMy son.  \\n  \\nLeave me.  \\n  \\nCareful, master. Careful.  \\n  \\nVery far to fall.  \\n  \\nVery dangerous are the stairs.  \\n  \\nCome, master.  \\n  \\nCome to Sméagol.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nGet back, you!  \\n  \\nDon\\'t touch him!  \\n  \\nWhy does he hates poor Sméagol?  \\n  \\nWhat has Sméagol ever done to him?  \\n  \\nMaster?  \\n  \\nMaster carries heavy burden.  \\n  \\nSméagol knows.  \\nHeavy, heavy burden.  \\n  \\nFat one cannot know.  \\n  \\nSméagol look after master.  \\n  \\nHe wants it.  \\n  \\nHe needs it.  \\nSméagol sees it in his eye.  \\n  \\nVery soon he will ask you for it.  \\nYou will see.  \\n  \\nThe fat one will take it from you.  \\n  \\nSend forth all legions.  \\n  \\nDo not stop the attack  \\nuntil the city is taken.  \\n  \\nSlay them all.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What of the wizard?  \\n\\\\- I will break him.  \\n  \\nWhere are Théoden\\'s riders?  \\n  \\nWill Rohan\\'s army come?  \\n  \\nMithrandir.  \\n  \\nCourage is the best defense  \\nthat you have now.  \\n  \\nWhat were you thinking, Peregrin Took?  \\n  \\nWhat service can a Hobbit  \\noffer such a great lord of Men?  \\n  \\nIt was well-done.  \\n  \\nA generous deed should not  \\nbe checked with cold counsel.  \\n  \\nYou are to join the tower guard.  \\n  \\nI didn\\'t think they would find any livery  \\nthat would fit me.  \\n  \\nOnce belonged to a young boy  \\nof the city.  \\n  \\nA very foolish one...  \\n  \\n...who wasted many hours slaying dragons  \\ninstead of attending to his studies.  \\n  \\n\\\\- This was yours?  \\n\\\\- Yes, it was mine.  \\n  \\nMy father had it made for me.  \\n  \\nWell...  \\n  \\n...I\\'m taller than you were then.  \\n  \\nThough I\\'m not likely to grow anymore,  \\nexcept sideways.  \\n  \\nNever fitted me either.  \\n  \\nBoromir was always the soldier.  \\n  \\nThey were so alike, he and my father.  \\n  \\nProud.  \\n  \\nStubborn even.  \\n  \\nBut strong.  \\n  \\nI think you have strength  \\nof a different kind.  \\n  \\nAnd one day your father will see it.  \\n  \\nHere do I swear fealty  \\nand service to Gondor...  \\n  \\n...in peace or war...  \\n  \\n...in living or dying...  \\n  \\n...from...  \\n  \\nFrom this hour henceforth...  \\n  \\n...until my lord release me...  \\n  \\n...or death take me.  \\n  \\nAnd I shall not forget it...  \\n  \\n...nor fail to reward  \\nthat which is given.  \\n  \\nFealty with love.  \\n  \\nValor with honor.  \\n  \\nDisloyalty with vengeance.  \\n  \\nI do not think we should so lightly  \\nabandon the outer defenses...  \\n  \\n...defenses that your brother  \\nlong held intact.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What would you have me do?  \\n\\\\- I will not yield...  \\n  \\n...the river in Pelennor unfought.  \\n  \\nOsgiliath must be retaken.  \\n  \\nMy lord, Osgiliath is overrun.  \\n  \\nMuch must be risked in war.  \\n  \\nIs there a captain here who still has  \\nthe courage to do his lord\\'s will?  \\n  \\nYou wish now that our places  \\nhad been exchanged...  \\n  \\n...that I had died  \\nand Boromir had lived.  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nI wish that.  \\n  \\nSince you were robbed  \\nof Boromir...  \\n  \\n...I will do what I can  \\nin his stead.  \\n  \\nIf I should return,  \\nthink better of me, Father.  \\n  \\nThat will depend on the manner  \\nof your return.  \\n  \\nUgh.  \\n  \\nWhat are you up to?  \\n  \\nSneaking off, are we?  \\n  \\nSneaking?  \\n  \\nSneaking?  \\n  \\nFat Hobbit is always so polite.  \\n  \\nSméagol shows them secret ways  \\nthat nobody else could find...  \\n  \\n...and they say \"sneak.\"  \\n  \\nSneak?  \\n  \\nVery nice friend.  \\nOh, yes, my precious.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Very nice, very nice.  \\n\\\\- All right. All right!  \\n  \\nYou just startled me is all.  \\n  \\nWhat were you doing?  \\n  \\nSneaking.  \\n  \\nFine. Have it your own way.  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nWe have to be moving on.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s dark still.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s always dark here.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s gone!  \\n  \\n\\\\- The Elven bread.  \\n\\\\- What?  \\n  \\nThat\\'s all we have left.  \\n  \\nHe took it. He must have!  \\n  \\nSméagol?  \\nNo, no, not poor Sméagol.  \\n  \\nSméagol hates nasty Elf bread.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re a lying rat!  \\nWhat did you do with it?!  \\n  \\nHe doesn\\'t eat it.  \\n  \\n\\\\- He can\\'t have taken it.  \\n\\\\- Look.  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s this?  \\n  \\nCrumbs on his jacketses.  \\nHe took it!  \\n  \\nHe took it.  \\n  \\nI seen him. He\\'s always stuffing  \\nhis face when master\\'s not looking.  \\n  \\nThat\\'s a filthy lie!  \\n  \\nYou stinking, two-faced sneak!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Sam!  \\n\\\\- Call me--  \\n  \\nStop it!  \\n  \\nSam!  \\n  \\n\\\\- I\\'ll kill him!  \\n\\\\- Sam! No!  \\n  \\nOh, my-- I\\'m sorry. I didn\\'t mean it  \\nto go so far. I was just so-- So angry.  \\n  \\nHere, just--  \\nLet\\'s just rest a bit.  \\n  \\n\\\\- I\\'m all right.  \\n\\\\- No.  \\n  \\nNo, you\\'re not all right.  \\nYou\\'re exhausted.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s that Gollum.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s this place.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s that thing around your neck.  \\n  \\nI could help a bit.  \\n  \\nI could carry it for a while.  \\n  \\nCarry it for a while.  \\n  \\nI could carry it...I could carry it.  \\n  \\nShare the load...Share the load...  \\nthe load...the load.  \\n  \\nGet away!  \\n  \\nI don\\'t want to keep it.  \\n  \\nI just want to help.  \\n  \\nSee? See?  \\n  \\nHe wants it for himself.  \\n  \\nShut up, you!  \\n  \\nGo away!  \\nGet out of here!  \\n  \\nNo, Sam.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s you.  \\n  \\nI\\'m sorry, Sam.  \\n  \\nBut he\\'s a liar.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s poisoned you against me.  \\n  \\nYou can\\'t help me anymore.  \\n  \\nYou don\\'t mean that.  \\n  \\nGo home.  \\n  \\nFaramir!  \\n  \\nFaramir!  \\n  \\nYour father\\'s will has turned  \\nto madness.  \\n  \\nDo not throw away your life  \\nso rashly.  \\n  \\nWhere does my allegiance lie  \\nif not here?  \\n  \\nThis is the city of the Men of Númenor.  \\n  \\nI will gladly give my life  \\nto defend her beauty...  \\n  \\n...her memory, her wisdom.  \\n  \\nYour father loves you, Faramir.  \\n  \\nHe will remember it  \\nbefore the end.  \\n  \\nCan you sing, Master Hobbit?  \\n  \\nWell...  \\n  \\n...yes.  \\n  \\nAt least, well enough  \\nfor my own people.  \\n  \\nBut we have no songs  \\nfor great halls...  \\n  \\n...and evil times.  \\n  \\nAnd why should your songs  \\nbe unfit for my halls?  \\n  \\nCome, sing me a song.  \\n  \\nHome is behind  \\n  \\nThe world ahead  \\n  \\nAnd there are many paths to tread  \\n  \\nThrough shadow  \\n  \\nTo the edge of night  \\n  \\nUntil the stars are all alight  \\n  \\nMist and shadow  \\n  \\nCloud and shade  \\n  \\nAll shall fade  \\n  \\nAll shall  \\n  \\nFade  \\n  \\nMarch! March!  \\n  \\nMarch! March! March!  \\n  \\nMake way for the king.  \\n  \\nMake way.  \\n  \\nThe king is here.  \\n  \\nMy lord.  \\n  \\nHail to you, sire.  \\n  \\nGrimbold, how many?  \\n  \\nI bring 500 men from the Westfold,  \\nmy lord.  \\n  \\nWe have 300 more  \\nfrom Fenmarch, Théoden King.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Where are the riders from Snowbourn?  \\n\\\\- None have come, my lord.  \\n  \\nSix thousand spears.  \\n  \\nLess than half of what I\\'d hoped for.  \\n  \\nSix thousand will not be enough  \\nto break the lines of Mordor.  \\n  \\nMore will come.  \\n  \\nEvery hour lost hastens Gondor\\'s defeat.  \\n  \\nWe have till dawn,  \\nthen we must ride.  \\n  \\nThe horses are restless...  \\n  \\n...and the men are quiet.  \\n  \\nThey grow nervous in the shadow  \\nof the mountain.  \\n  \\nThat road there...  \\n  \\n...where does that lead?  \\n  \\nIt is the road to the Dimholt,  \\nthe door under the mountain.  \\n  \\nNone who venture there ever return.  \\n  \\nThat mountain is evil.  \\n  \\nHold!  \\n  \\nAragorn.  \\n  \\nLet\\'s find some food.  \\n  \\nThere.  \\n  \\nA true esquire of Rohan.  \\n  \\nI\\'m ready.  \\n  \\nSorry.  \\n  \\nIt isn\\'t all that dangerous.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s not even sharp.  \\n  \\nWell, that\\'s no good. You won\\'t kill  \\nmany Orcs with a blunt blade.  \\n  \\nCome on.  \\n  \\nTo the smithy. Go!  \\n  \\nYou should not encourage him.  \\n  \\nYou should not doubt him.  \\n  \\nI do not doubt his heart,  \\nonly the reach of his arm.  \\n  \\nWhy should Merry be left behind?  \\n  \\nHe has as much cause  \\nto go to war as you.  \\n  \\nWhy can he not fight  \\nfor those he loves?  \\n  \\nYou know as little of war  \\nas that Hobbit.  \\n  \\nWhen the fear takes him...  \\n  \\n...and the blood and the screams  \\nand the horror of battle take hold...  \\n  \\n...do you think he would stand and fight?  \\n  \\nHe would flee.  \\n  \\nAnd he would be right to do so.  \\n  \\nWar is the province of Men, Éowyn.  \\n  \\nI choose a mortal life.  \\n  \\nI wish I could\\'ve seen him...  \\n  \\n...one last time.  \\n  \\nSir?  \\n  \\nKing Théoden awaits you, my lord.  \\n  \\nI take my leave.  \\n  \\nMy lord Elrond.  \\n  \\nI come on behalf of one whom I love.  \\n  \\nArwen is dying.  \\n  \\nShe will not long survive the evil  \\nthat now spreads from Mordor.  \\n  \\nThe light of the Evenstar is failing.  \\n  \\nAs Sauron\\'s power grows,  \\nher strength wanes.  \\n  \\nArwen\\'s life is now tied  \\nto the fate of the Ring.  \\n  \\nThe Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.  \\n  \\nThe end has come.  \\n  \\nIt will not be our end, but his.  \\n  \\nYou ride to war, but not to victory.  \\n  \\nSauron\\'s armies march on Minas Tirith,  \\nthis you know.  \\n  \\nBut in secret he sends another force  \\nwhich will attack from the river.  \\n  \\nA fleet of Corsair ships sails  \\nfrom the south.  \\n  \\nThey\\'ll be in the city in two days.  \\n  \\nYou\\'re outnumbered, Aragorn.  \\n  \\nYou need more men.  \\n  \\nThere are none.  \\n  \\nThere are those who dwell  \\nin the mountain.  \\n  \\nMurderers...  \\n  \\n...traitors.  \\n  \\nYou would call upon them to fight?  \\n  \\nThey believe in nothing.  \\n  \\nThey answer to no one.  \\n  \\nThey will answer  \\nto the king of Gondor.  \\n  \\nAndúril, the Flame of the West,  \\nforged from the shards of Narsil.  \\n  \\nSauron will not have forgotten  \\nthe Sword of Elendil.  \\n  \\nThe blade that was broken  \\nshall return to Minas Tirith.  \\n  \\nThe man who can wield  \\nthe power of this sword...  \\n  \\n...can summon to him an army more  \\ndeadly than any that walks this earth.  \\n  \\nPut aside the Ranger.  \\n  \\nBecome who you were born to be.  \\n  \\nTake the Dimholt road.  \\n  \\nI give hope to Men.  \\n  \\nI keep none for myself.  \\n  \\nWhy are you doing this?  \\n  \\nThe war lies to the east.  \\nYou cannot leave on the eve of battle.  \\n  \\nYou cannot abandon the men.  \\n  \\nÉowyn...  \\n  \\nWe need you here.  \\n  \\nWhy have you come?  \\n  \\nDo you not know?  \\n  \\nIt is but a shadow and a thought  \\nthat you love.  \\n  \\nI cannot give you what you seek.  \\n  \\nI have wished you joy  \\nsince first I saw you.  \\n  \\nJust where do you think you\\'re off to?  \\n  \\nNot this time.  \\n  \\n\\\\- This time you must stay, Gimli.  \\n\\\\- Mm.  \\n  \\nHave you learned nothing  \\nof the stubbornness of Dwarves?  \\n  \\nYou might as well accept it.  \\nWe\\'re going with you, laddie.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What\\'s happening?  \\n\\\\- Where is he going?  \\n  \\nWhere\\'s he going?  \\n  \\nI don\\'t understand.  \\n  \\nLord Aragorn!  \\n  \\nWhy does he leave on the eve of battle?  \\n  \\nHe leaves because there is no hope.  \\n  \\nHe leaves because he must.  \\n  \\nToo few have come.  \\n  \\nWe cannot defeat  \\nthe armies of Mordor.  \\n  \\nNo...  \\n  \\n...we cannot.  \\n  \\nBut we will meet them  \\nin battle nonetheless.  \\n  \\nI have left instruction.  \\n  \\nThe people are to follow  \\nyour rule in my stead.  \\n  \\nTake up my seat in the Golden Hall.  \\n  \\nLong may you defend Edoras...  \\n  \\n...if the battle goes ill.  \\n  \\nWhat other duty would you  \\nhave me do, my lord?  \\n  \\nDuty?  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nI would have you smile again...  \\n  \\n...not grieve for those  \\nwhose time has come.  \\n  \\nYou shall live to see  \\nthese days renewed...  \\n  \\n...and no more despair.  \\n  \\nWhat kind of army would linger  \\nin such a place?  \\n  \\nOne that is cursed.  \\n  \\nLong ago, the Men of the Mountains  \\nswore an oath...  \\n  \\n...to the last king of Gondor...  \\n  \\n...to come to his aid...  \\n  \\n...to fight.  \\n  \\nBut when the time came...  \\n  \\n...when Gondor\\'s need was dire...  \\n  \\n...they fled...  \\n  \\n...vanishing into the darkness  \\nof the mountain.  \\n  \\nAnd so Isildur cursed them...  \\n  \\n...never to rest until they had  \\nfulfilled their pledge.  \\n  \\nWho shall call them  \\nfrom the Grey twilight?  \\n  \\nThe forgotten people.  \\n  \\nThe heir of him to whom  \\nthe oath they swore.  \\n  \\nFrom the north shall he come.  \\n  \\nNeed shall drive him.  \\n  \\nHe shall pass the door  \\nto the Paths of the Dead.  \\n  \\nThe very warmth of my blood  \\nseems stolen away.  \\n  \\nThe way is shut.  \\n  \\nIt was made by those  \\nwho are dead.  \\n  \\nAnd the Dead keep it.  \\n  \\nThe way is shut.  \\n  \\nBrego!  \\n  \\nI do not fear death.  \\n  \\nWell, this is a thing unheard-of.  \\n  \\nAn Elf will go underground  \\nwhere a Dwarf dare not?  \\n  \\nOh.  \\n  \\nOh, I\\'d never hear the end of it.  \\n  \\nWe must ride light and swift.  \\n  \\nIt is a long road ahead.  \\n  \\nAnd man and beast must reach the end  \\nwith the strength to fight.  \\n  \\nLittle Hobbits do not belong in war,  \\nMaster Meriadoc.  \\n  \\nAll my friends have gone to battle.  \\n  \\nI would be ashamed to be left behind.  \\n  \\nIt is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.  \\n  \\nAnd none of my riders can bear you  \\nas a burden.  \\n  \\nI want to fight.  \\n  \\nI will say no more.  \\n  \\nRide with me.  \\n  \\nMy lady.  \\n  \\nForm up! Move out!  \\n  \\nForm up! Move out!  \\n  \\nRide!  \\n  \\nRide now to Gondor!  \\n  \\nWhat is it?  \\n  \\nWhat do you see?  \\n  \\nI see shapes of men.  \\n  \\nAnd of horses.  \\n  \\nWhere?  \\n  \\nPale banners like shreds of cloud.  \\n  \\nSpears rise...  \\n  \\n...like winter-thickets  \\nthrough a shroud of mist.  \\n  \\nThe Dead are following.  \\n  \\nThey have been summoned.  \\n  \\nThe Dead?  \\n  \\nSummoned?  \\n  \\nI knew that.  \\n  \\nHuh. Ha.  \\n  \\nVery good.  \\n  \\nVery good! Legolas!  \\n  \\nDo not look down.  \\n  \\nWho enters my domain?  \\n  \\nOne who will have your allegiance.  \\n  \\nThe Dead do not suffer the living to pass.  \\n  \\nYou will suffer me.  \\n  \\nThe way is shut.  \\n  \\nIt was made by those who are dead.  \\n  \\nAnd the Dead keep it.  \\n  \\nThe way is shut.  \\n  \\nNow you must die.  \\n  \\nI summon you to fulfill your oath.  \\n  \\nNone but the king of Gondor  \\nmay command me.  \\n  \\nThat line was broken.  \\n  \\nIt has been remade.  \\n  \\nFight for us...  \\n  \\n...and regain your honor.  \\n  \\nWhat say you?  \\n  \\nWhat say you?  \\n  \\nAh! You waste your time, Aragorn.  \\n  \\nThey had no honor in life,  \\nthey have none now in death.  \\n  \\nI am Isildur\\'s heir.  \\n  \\nFight for me...  \\n  \\n...and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.  \\n  \\nWhat say you?  \\n  \\nYou have my word!  \\n  \\nFight, and I will release you  \\nfrom this living death!  \\n  \\nWhat say you?!  \\n  \\nStand, you traitors!  \\n  \\nOut!  \\n  \\nLegolas!  \\n  \\nRun!  \\n  \\nWe fight.  \\n  \\nOpen the gate! Quick!  \\n  \\nQuick! Hurry!  \\n  \\nFaramir!  \\n  \\nSay not that he has fallen.  \\n  \\nThey were outnumbered.  \\n  \\nNone survived.  \\n  \\nFear.  \\n  \\nThe city is rank with it.  \\n  \\nLet us ease their pain.  \\n  \\nRelease the prisoners.  \\n  \\nCatapults!  \\n  \\nShields up!  \\n  \\nMy sons are spent.  \\n  \\nMy line has ended.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s alive!  \\n  \\nThe House of Stewards has failed.  \\n  \\nHe needs medicine, my lord.  \\n  \\nMy line has ended!  \\n  \\nMy lord!  \\n  \\nPut it in!  \\n  \\nRohan...  \\n  \\n...has deserted us.  \\n  \\nThéoden\\'s betrayed me.  \\n  \\nAbandon your posts!  \\n  \\nFlee! Flee for your lives!  \\n  \\nOh!  \\n  \\nPrepare for battle!  \\n  \\nHurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!  \\n  \\nOver here!  \\n  \\nReturn to your posts!  \\n  \\nSend these foul beasts into the abyss.  \\n  \\nStay where you are.  \\n  \\nWe need more rubble!  \\n  \\nWatch out!  \\n  \\nDown to the lower levels. Quick!  \\n  \\nDouble up, men!  \\n  \\nYah!  \\n  \\nHold them back! Do not give in to fear.  \\n  \\nStand to your posts! Fight!  \\n  \\nNot at the towers!  \\n  \\nAim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!  \\n  \\nBring them down!  \\n  \\nFight them back!  \\n  \\nPeregrin Took!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Go back to the Citadel!  \\n\\\\- They\\'d called us out to fight.  \\n  \\nThis is no place for a Hobbit.  \\n  \\nGuard of the Citadel, indeed.  \\n  \\nNow, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!  \\n  \\nWhat are you doing,  \\nyou useless scum?!  \\n  \\nThe door won\\'t give. It\\'s too strong.  \\n  \\nGet back there and smash it down.  \\n  \\nBut nothing can breach it.  \\n  \\nGrond will breach it.  \\n  \\nBring up the wolf\\'s head.  \\n  \\nGrond! Grond! Grond! Grond!  \\n  \\nGrond! Grond! Grond!  \\n  \\nGrond! Grond! Grond!  \\n  \\nGrond! Grond! Grond!  \\n  \\nGrond! Grond! Grond!  \\n  \\nGrond! Grond! Grond!  \\n  \\nYou may go no further.  \\n  \\nYou will not enter Gondor.  \\n  \\nWho are you to deny us passage?  \\n  \\nLegolas, fire a warning shot  \\npast the bosun\\'s ear.  \\n  \\nMind your aim.  \\n  \\nOh!  \\n  \\nThat\\'s it. Right. We warned you.  \\n  \\nPrepare to be boarded.  \\n  \\nBoarded?  \\n  \\nBy you and whose army?  \\n  \\nThis army.  \\n  \\nIn there.  \\n  \\nWhat is this place?  \\n  \\nMaster must go inside the tunnel.  \\n  \\nNow that I\\'m here, I don\\'t think I want to.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s the only way.  \\n  \\nGo in...  \\n  \\n...or go back.  \\n  \\nI can\\'t go back.  \\n  \\n\\\\- What\\'s that smell?  \\n\\\\- Orcses\\' filth.  \\n  \\nOrcses come in here sometimes.  \\n  \\nHurry.  \\n  \\nThis way.  \\n  \\nSméagol?  \\n  \\nOver here.  \\n  \\nOh!  \\n  \\nAah! Aah!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s sticky. What is it?  \\n  \\nYou\\'ll see.  \\n  \\nOh, yes.  \\n  \\nYou will see.  \\n  \\nSméagol?  \\n  \\nSméagol!  \\n  \\nSméagol!  \\n  \\nSam.  \\n  \\nAnd you, Frodo Baggins...  \\n  \\n...I give you the light of Eärendil,  \\nour most beloved star.  \\n  \\nMay it be a light for you  \\nin dark places...  \\n  \\n...when all other lights go out.  \\n  \\nNaughty little fly  \\n  \\nWhy does he cry?  \\n  \\nCaught in a web  \\n  \\nSoon you\\'ll be...  \\n  \\nEaten.  \\n  \\nGot away, did it, precious?  \\n  \\nNot this time.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Not this time!  \\n\\\\- No!  \\n  \\nIt wasn\\'t us. It wasn\\'t us!  \\n  \\nSméagol wouldn\\'t hurt master.  \\n  \\nWe promised.  \\n  \\nYou must believe us.  \\n  \\nIt was the precious.  \\n  \\nThe precious made us do it.  \\n  \\nI have to destroy it, Sméagol.  \\n  \\nI have to destroy it for both our sakes.  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\nI\\'m so sorry, Sam.  \\n  \\nI\\'m so sorry.  \\n  \\nThis task was appointed  \\nto you, Frodo of the Shire.  \\n  \\nIf you do not find a way...  \\n  \\n...no one will.  \\n  \\nThe scouts report  \\nMinas Tirith is surrounded.  \\n  \\nThe lower level\\'s in flames.  \\n  \\nEverywhere,  \\nlegions of the enemy advance.  \\n  \\nTime is against us.  \\n  \\nMake ready!  \\n  \\nTake heart, Merry.  \\n  \\nIt will soon be over.  \\n  \\nMy lady...  \\n  \\n...you are fair and brave...  \\n  \\n...and have much to live for...  \\n  \\n...and many who love you.  \\n  \\nI know it is too late to turn aside.  \\n  \\nI know there is not much point  \\nnow in hoping.  \\n  \\nIf I were a knight of Rohan,  \\ncapable of great deeds...  \\n  \\nBut I\\'m not.  \\n  \\nI\\'m a Hobbit.  \\n  \\nAnd I know I can\\'t save Middle-earth.  \\n  \\nI just want to help my friends.  \\n  \\nFrodo.  \\n  \\nSam.  \\n  \\nPippin.  \\n  \\nMore than anything,  \\nI wish I could see them again.  \\n  \\nPrepare to move out!  \\n  \\nMake haste.  \\nWe ride through the night.  \\n  \\nTo battle.  \\n  \\nTo battle.  \\n  \\nBack to the gate!  \\n  \\nHurry!  \\n  \\nI am steward of the House of Anárion.  \\n  \\nThus have I walked.  \\n  \\nAnd thus now will I sleep.  \\n  \\nGondor is lost.  \\n  \\nThere is no hope for Men.  \\n  \\nWhy do the fools fly?  \\n  \\nBetter to die sooner than late.  \\n  \\nFor die we must.  \\n  \\nNo tomb for Denethor  \\nand Faramir.  \\n  \\nNo long, slow sleep of death embalmed.  \\n  \\nWe shall burn,  \\nlike the heathen kings of old.  \\n  \\nBring wood and oil.  \\n  \\nSteady.  \\n  \\nSteady.  \\n  \\nYou are soldiers of Gondor.  \\n  \\nNo matter what comes through that gate,  \\nyou will stand your ground.  \\n  \\nRun!  \\n  \\nVolley!  \\n  \\nFire!  \\n  \\nLet him go, you filth.  \\n  \\nLet him go!  \\n  \\nYou will not touch him again.  \\n  \\nCome on and finish it.  \\n  \\nHa! Back!  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nOh, no.  \\n  \\nFrodo.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nWake up.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t leave me here alone.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t go where I can\\'t follow.  \\n  \\nWake up.  \\n  \\nNot asleep.  \\n  \\nDead.  \\n  \\nYou get back, you scum!  \\n  \\nWhat\\'s this?  \\n  \\nLooks like old Shelob\\'s  \\nbeen having a bit of fun.  \\n  \\nKilled another one, has she?  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nThis fellow ain\\'t dead.  \\n  \\nNot dead?  \\n  \\nShe jabs him with her stinger,  \\nand he goes as limp as a boned fish.  \\n  \\nThen she has her way with them.  \\n  \\nThat\\'s how she likes to feed.  \\n  \\nFresh blood.  \\n  \\nGet him to the tower!  \\n  \\nSamwise, you fool.  \\n  \\nThis scum will be awake  \\nin a couple of hours.  \\n  \\nThen he\\'ll wish he\\'d never been born.  \\n  \\nThe house of his spirit crumbles.  \\n  \\nHe is burning.  \\n  \\nAlready burning.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s not dead.  \\n  \\nHe\\'s not dead!  \\n  \\nNo! No!  \\n  \\nNo! No!  \\n  \\nHe\\'s not dead!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.  \\n\\\\- No! No! No!  \\n  \\nI release you from my service.  \\n  \\nGo now and die in what way  \\nseems best to you.  \\n  \\nPour oil on the wood!  \\n  \\nCome on, soldier! Move it!  \\n  \\n\\\\- Hurry along there! Hurry along!  \\n\\\\- Gandalf!  \\n  \\nWhere is Gandalf?  \\n  \\nGandalf!  \\n  \\nRetreat!  \\n  \\nThe city is breached!  \\n  \\nFall back to the second level!  \\n  \\nGet the women and children out!  \\n  \\nGet them out!  \\n  \\nRetreat!  \\n  \\nCome on.

Quickly!  \\n  \\nGo back to the abyss.  \\n  \\nFall into the nothingness  \\nthat awaits you and your master.  \\n  \\nDo you not know death  \\nwhen you see it, old man?  \\n  \\nThis is my hour.  \\n  \\nGandalf!  \\n  \\nYou have failed.  \\n  \\nThe world of Men will fall.  \\n  \\nCourage, Merry.  \\n  \\nCourage for our friends.  \\n  \\nForm ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!  \\n  \\nPikes in front.

To me!  \\n  \\nFeast on his flesh.  \\n  \\nI will kill you if you touch him.  \\n  \\nDo not come between  \\nthe Nazgûl and his prey.  \\n  \\nLate as usual, pirate scum!  \\n  \\nThere\\'s knife-work here needs doing.  \\n  \\nCome on, you sea rats!  \\nGet off your ships!  \\n  \\nThere\\'s plenty for the both of us.  \\n  \\nMay the best Dwarf win.  \\n  \\nYou fool.  \\n  \\nNo man can kill me.  \\n  \\nDie now.  \\n  \\nI am no man.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Fifteen! Sixteen!  \\n\\\\- Seventeen!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nLegolas!  \\n  \\nThirty-three, thirty-four.  \\n  \\nThat still only counts as one!  \\n  \\nCome on, then. Come on!  \\n  \\nI know your face...  \\n  \\n...Éowyn.  \\n  \\nMy eyes darken.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nI am going to save you.  \\n  \\nYou already did.  \\n  \\nÉowyn...  \\n  \\n...my body is broken.  \\n  \\nYou have to let me go.  \\n  \\nI go to my fathers...  \\n  \\n...in whose mighty company...  \\n  \\n...I shall not now feel ashamed.  \\n  \\nÉowyn.  \\n  \\nRelease us.  \\n  \\nBad idea.  \\n  \\nVery handy in a tight spot, these lads,  \\ndespite the fact they\\'re dead.  \\n  \\nYou gave us your word.  \\n  \\nI hold your oath fulfilled.  \\n  \\nGo.  \\n  \\nBe at peace.  \\n  \\nMerry.  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nMerry!  \\n  \\nMerry.  \\n  \\nMerry, it\\'s me.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s Pippin.  \\n  \\nI knew you\\'d find me.  \\n  \\nYes.  \\n  \\nAre you going to leave me?  \\n  \\nNo, Merry.  \\n  \\nI\\'m going to look after you.  \\n  \\nHands off!  \\n  \\nThat shiny shirt, that\\'s mine.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s going to the Great Eye,  \\nalong with everything else.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t take orders from  \\nstinking Morgul-rats!  \\n  \\nYou touch it, and I\\'ll stick  \\nthis blade in your gut.  \\n  \\nThe scum tried to knife me.  \\n  \\nKill him!  \\n  \\nThat\\'s for Frodo!  \\n  \\nAnd for the Shire!  \\n  \\nAnd that\\'s for my old Gaffer!  \\n  \\nStop your squealing, you dunghill rat.  \\n  \\nI\\'m gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Not if I stick you first.  \\n\\\\- Sam!  \\n  \\nOh, Sam, I\\'m so sorry.  \\n  \\nSorry for everything.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Let\\'s get you out of here.  \\n\\\\- It\\'s too late. It\\'s over.  \\n  \\nThey\\'ve taken it. Sam...  \\n  \\n...they took the Ring.  \\n  \\nBegging your pardon, but they haven\\'t.  \\n  \\nI thought I\\'d lost you.  \\n  \\nSo I took it.  \\n  \\nOnly for safekeeping.  \\n  \\nGive it to me.  \\n  \\nGive me the Ring, Sam.  \\n  \\nSam.  \\n  \\nGive me the Ring.  \\n  \\nYou must understand.  \\n  \\nThe Ring is my burden.  \\n  \\nIt will destroy you, Sam.  \\n  \\nCome on, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nWe best find you some clothes.  \\n  \\nYou can\\'t go walking through Mordor  \\nin naught but your skin.  \\n  \\nWe did it, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nWe made it to Mordor.  \\n  \\nThere are so many of them.  \\n  \\nWe\\'ll never get through unseen.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s him, the Eye.  \\n  \\nWe have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s nothing for it.  \\n  \\nCome on. Let\\'s just make it  \\ndown the hill for starters.  \\n  \\nFrodo has passed beyond my sight.  \\n  \\nThe darkness is deepening.  \\n  \\nIf Sauron had the Ring,  \\nwe would know it.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s only a matter of time.  \\n  \\nHe has suffered a defeat, yes...  \\n  \\n...but behind the walls of Mordor,  \\nour enemy is regrouping.  \\n  \\nLet him stay there.  \\n  \\nLet him rot! Why should we care?  \\n  \\nBecause 10,000 Orcs now stand  \\nbetween Frodo and Mount Doom.  \\n  \\nI\\'ve sent him to his death.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nThere is still hope for Frodo.  \\n  \\nHe needs time and safe passage  \\nacross the plains of Gorgoroth.  \\n  \\n\\\\- We can give him that.  \\n\\\\- How?  \\n  \\nDraw out Sauron\\'s armies.  \\n  \\nEmpty his lands.  \\n  \\nThen we gather our full strength  \\nand march on the Black Gate.  \\n  \\nWe cannot achieve victory  \\nthrough strength of arms.  \\n  \\nNot for ourselves.  \\n  \\nBut we can give Frodo his chance  \\nif we keep Sauron\\'s Eye fixed upon us.  \\n  \\nKeep him blind to all else that moves.  \\n  \\nA diversion.  \\n  \\nCertainty of death...  \\n  \\n...small chance of success...  \\n  \\n...what are we waiting for?  \\n  \\nSauron will suspect a trap.  \\n  \\nHe will not take the bait.  \\n  \\nOh, I think he will.  \\n  \\nLong have you hunted me.  \\n  \\nLong have I eluded you.  \\n  \\nNo more.  \\n  \\nBehold the Sword of Elendil.  \\n  \\nThe city has fallen silent.  \\n  \\nThere is no warmth left in the sun.  \\n  \\nIt grows so cold.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s just the damp  \\nof the first spring rain.  \\n  \\nI do not believe this darkness  \\nwill endure.  \\n  \\nLook, the Orcs...  \\n  \\n...they\\'re moving off.  \\n  \\nYou see, Mr. Frodo...  \\n  \\n...some luck at last.  \\n  \\nMove it, you slugs!  \\n  \\nCome on! Faster!  \\n  \\nCome along, you scum...  \\n  \\nI\\'ll whip you down to the bone, you...  \\n  \\nCome on!  \\n  \\nWhat have I told you?!  \\n  \\nGet up!  \\n  \\nCome on, you slugs!  \\n  \\nYou two are going straight  \\nto the front line!  \\n  \\nNow, move it! Go on!  \\nFall in! Move it!  \\n  \\nTo the Gate, you slugs!  \\nNow, move it!  \\n  \\nDon\\'t you know we\\'re at war?  \\n  \\nCompany, halt!  \\n  \\nInspection!  \\n  \\nSam, help me.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo!  \\n  \\nStand up, Mr. Frodo.  \\nStand up!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s so heavy.  \\n  \\nOh, no.  \\n  \\nWhat do I do?  \\nWhat do we do?  \\n  \\n\\\\- Hit me.  \\n\\\\- What?  \\n  \\nHit me, Sam. Start fighting.  \\n  \\nGet off of me!  \\n  \\nNobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.  \\n  \\nGet off of me!  \\n  \\nBreak it up! Break it up!  \\n  \\nOi! I\\'ll have your guts if you don\\'t  \\nshut this rabble down!  \\n  \\nGo, Sam. Now!  \\n  \\nMove along, scum!  \\n  \\nBack in the line!  \\n  \\nYou maggots!  \\n  \\nGet back into the line,  \\nyou slugs!  \\n  \\nDig it, you slugs. Move it.  \\n  \\nMove it!  \\n  \\nI can\\'t...  \\n  \\nI can\\'t...  \\nI can\\'t manage the Ring, Sam.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s... It\\'s...  \\n  \\nIt\\'s such a weight to carry.  \\n  \\nIt...  \\n  \\nSuch a weight.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re going that way.  \\nStraight as we can.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s no point carrying anything  \\nwe\\'re not sure to need.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nLook.  \\n  \\nThere is light...  \\n  \\n...and beauty up there...  \\n  \\n...that no shadow can touch.  \\n  \\nTake mine.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s a few drops left.  \\n  \\nThere will be none left  \\nfor the return journey.  \\n  \\nI don\\'t think there will be  \\na return journey, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nFrodo, get down!  \\n  \\nHide!  \\n  \\nFrodo!  \\n  \\nWhere are they?  \\n  \\nLet the Lord of the Black Land come forth!  \\n  \\nLet justice be done upon him!  \\n  \\nMy master, Sauron the Great,  \\nbids thee welcome.  \\n  \\nIs there any in this rout  \\nwith authority to treat with me?  \\n  \\nWe do not come to treat with Sauron...  \\n  \\n...faithless and accursed.  \\n  \\nTell your master this:  \\nThe armies of Mordor must disband.  \\n  \\nHe is to depart these lands,  \\nnever to return.  \\n  \\nAha. Old Greybeard.  \\n  \\nI have a token I was bidden  \\nto show thee.  \\n  \\nFrodo.  \\n  \\nFrodo.  \\n  \\n\\\\- Silence.  \\n\\\\- No!  \\n  \\nSilence!  \\n  \\nThe Halfling was dear to thee, I see.  \\n  \\nKnow that he suffered greatly  \\nat the hands of his host.  \\n  \\nWho would\\'ve thought one so small  \\ncould endure so much pain?  \\n  \\nAnd he did, Gandalf.  \\n  \\nHe did.  \\n  \\nAnd who is this?  \\n  \\nIsildur\\'s heir?  \\n  \\nIt takes more to make a king  \\nthan a broken Elvish blade.  \\n  \\nI guess that concludes negotiations.  \\n  \\nI do not believe it.  \\n  \\nI will not.  \\n  \\nPull back.  \\n  \\nPull back!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s gone, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nThe light\\'s passed on,  \\naway towards the north.  \\n  \\nSomething\\'s drawn its gaze.  \\n  \\nHold your ground! Hold your ground.  \\n  \\nSons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!  \\n  \\nI see in your eyes...  \\n  \\n...the same fear that would take  \\nthe heart of me.  \\n  \\nA day may come  \\nwhen the courage of Men fails...  \\n  \\n...when we forsake our friends  \\nand break all bonds of fellowship.  \\n  \\nBut it is not this day.  \\n  \\nAn hour of wolves  \\nand shattered shields...  \\n  \\n...when the age of Men  \\ncomes crashing down.  \\n  \\nBut it is not this day.  \\n  \\nThis day we fight!  \\n  \\nBy all that you hold dear  \\non this good earth...  \\n  \\n...I bid you stand, Men of the West!  \\n  \\nNever thought I\\'d die fighting  \\nside by side with an Elf.  \\n  \\nWhat about side by side with a friend?  \\n  \\nAye.  \\n  \\nI could do that.  \\n  \\nDo you remember the Shire,  \\nMr. Frodo?  \\n  \\nIt\\'ll be spring soon.  \\n  \\nAnd the orchards will be in blossom.  \\n  \\nAnd the birds will be nesting  \\nin the hazel thicket.  \\n  \\nAnd they\\'ll be sowing  \\nthe summer barley in the lower fields...  \\n  \\n...and eating the first  \\nof the strawberries with cream.  \\n  \\nDo you remember  \\nthe taste of strawberries?  \\n  \\nNo, Sam.  \\n  \\nI can\\'t recall the taste of food...  \\n  \\n...nor the sound of water...  \\n  \\n...nor the touch of grass.  \\n  \\nI\\'m...  \\n  \\n...naked in the dark.  \\n  \\nThere\\'s-- There\\'s nothing.  \\n  \\nNo veil between me  \\nand the wheel of fire.  \\n  \\nI can see him...  \\n  \\n...with my waking eyes.  \\n  \\nThen let us be rid of it...  \\n  \\n...once and for all.  \\n  \\nCome on, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nI can\\'t carry it for you...  \\n  \\n...but I can carry you.  \\n  \\nCome on!  \\n  \\nAragorn.  \\n  \\nElessar.  \\n  \\nFor Frodo.  \\n  \\nLook, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nA doorway.  \\n  \\nWe\\'re almost there.  \\n  \\nClever Hobbits to climb so high!  \\n  \\nMustn\\'t go that way.  \\n  \\nMustn\\'t hurt the precious.  \\n  \\nYou swore!  \\n  \\nYou swore on the precious!  \\n  \\nSméagol promised!  \\n  \\nSméagol lied.  \\n  \\nFrodo!  \\n  \\nEagles.  \\n  \\nThe eagles are coming!  \\n  \\nFrodo!  \\n  \\nI\\'m here, Sam.  \\n  \\nDestroy it!  \\n  \\nGo on! Now!  \\n  \\nThrow it in the fire!  \\n  \\nWhat are you waiting for?  \\n  \\nJust let it go!  \\n  \\nThe Ring is mine.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nNo.  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\nYes!  \\n  \\nYes!  \\n  \\nPrecious! Precious!  \\n  \\nPrecious! Precious!  \\n  \\nGive me your hand!  \\n  \\nTake my hand!  \\n  \\nNo!  \\n  \\nDon\\'t you let go.  \\n  \\nDon\\'t let go.  \\n  \\nReach!  \\n  \\nFrodo!  \\n  \\nFrodo!  \\n  \\nIt\\'s gone.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s done.  \\n  \\nYes, Mr. Frodo.  \\n  \\nIt\\'s over now.  \\n  \\nI can see the Shire.  \\n  \\nThe Brandywine River.  \\n  \\nBag End.  \\n  \\nGandalf\\'s fireworks.  \\n  \\nThe lights in the Party Tree.  \\n  \\nRosie Cotton dancing.  \\n  \\nShe had ribbons in her hair.  \\n  \\nIf ever I was to marry someone...  \\n  \\n...it would\\'ve been her.  \\n  \\nIt would\\'ve been her.  \\n  \\nI\\'m glad to be with you,  \\nSamwise Gamgee...  \\n  \\n...here at the end of all things.  \\n  \\nGandalf?  \\n  \\nFrodo!  \\n  \\nGimli!  \\n  \\nNow come the days of the king.  \\n  \\nMay they be blessed.  \\n  \\nThis day does not belong to one man...  \\n  \\n...but to all.  \\n  \\nLet us together rebuild this world...  \\n  \\n...that we may share  \\nin the days of peace.  \\n  \\nMy friends...  \\n  \\n...you bow to no one.  \\n  \\nAnd thus it was.  \\n  \\nA Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.  \\n  \\nAnd the Fellowship of the Ring...  \\n  \\n...though eternally bound  \\nby friendship and love...  \\n  \\n...was ended.  \\n  \\nThirteen months to the day since Gandalf  \\nsent us on our long journey...  \\n  \\n...we found ourselves  \\nlooking upon a familiar sight.  \\n  \\nWe were home.  \\n  \\nHi.  \\n  \\nHey, watch the pumpkin.  \\n  \\nHey!  \\n  \\nMore of the same, Rosie.  \\n  \\nGood night, lads.  \\n  \\nHm?  \\n  \\nHow do you pick up the threads  \\nof an old life?  \\n  \\nHow do you go on...  \\n  \\n...when in your heart  \\nyou begin to understand...  \\n  \\n...there is no going back?  \\n  \\nThere are some things  \\nthat time cannot mend...  \\n  \\n...some hurts that go too deep...  \\n  \\n...that have taken hold.  \\n  \\nMr. Frodo?

       "\"What a great question!\\n\\nThe sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh. Here's what happens:\\n\\n1. **Light from the sun**: When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it contains all the colors of the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet).\\n2. **Interaction with molecules**: As light travels through the air, it encounters tiny molecules of gases like nitrogen (N2) and oxygen (O2). These molecules are much smaller than the wavelength of light.\\n3. **Scattering**: The smaller molecules scatter the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, more efficiently than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange. This is known as Rayleigh scattering.\\n4. **Blue dominance**: As a result of this scattering, the blue and violet light becomes dispersed throughout the atmosphere, reaching our eyes from all directions. The shorter wavelength of blue light makes it more easily scattered, which is why it appears more prominent in the sky.\\n5. **Atmospheric conditions**: Other factors can influence the color of the sky, such as:\\n\\t* Atmospheric particles: Dust, pollution, and water vapor can absorb or scatter certain wavelengths of light, making the sky appear more hazy or gray.\\n\\t* Angle of the sun: During sunrise and sunset, the sun's rays travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths like blue and violet, which is why the sky often appears orange or red during these times.\\n\\nIn summary, the combination of sunlight, atmospheric molecules, and Rayleigh scattering leads to the blue color we see in the sky!\""
